- **Citation**: Larry Guth, James Maynard, *New large value estimates for Dirichlet polynomials*, arXiv:2405.20552.
- **Primary relevance**:
  - **B2′ funnel (number theory side)**: delivers one of the best current *unconditional* links “large values ⇒ improved zero density”.
  - **Tao–Trudgian–Yang 2501.16779** explicitly uses/extends this technology.

### What the paper actually proves (key statements)

#### Theorem 1.1 (large values estimate; frequency bound)
Let \((b_n)\) be complex coefficients with \(|b_n|\le 1\), and let \(t_1,\dots,t_R\) be **1-separated** points in \([0,T]\).
If for all \(r\le R\),
\[
\Big|\sum_{n=N}^{2N} b_n\, n^{it_r}\Big| \ \ge\ V,
\]
then
\[
R \ \le\ T^{o(1)}\Big( N^2 V^{-2} \;+\; N^{18/5} V^{-4} \;+\; T\, N^{12/5} V^{-4}\Big).
\]
(The statement is “asymptotic-with-\(T^{o(1)}\)” rather than fully explicit constants.)

#### Theorem 1.2 (zero density estimate)
Let \(N(\sigma,T)\) denote the number of zeros \(\rho\) of \(\zeta(s)\) with \(\Re(\rho)\ge \sigma\) and \(|\Im(\rho)|\le T\).
Then:
\[
N(\sigma,T)\ \ll\ T^{\,15(1-\sigma)/(3+5\sigma)\;+\;o(1)}.
\]
They also state a derived bound (by combining with Ingham in a certain range):
\[
N(\sigma,T)\ \ll\ T^{\,30(1-\sigma)/13\;+\;o(1)} \quad (\text{with the comparison range specified in the paper}).
\]

### Mapping to our framework (Lean + manuscript)

#### How this could interact with μ-Carleson / B2′
In our Lean scaffold:
- `MuCarleson μ Cμ α` is a **uniform local packing bound** on the σ-weighted off-line zero measure in Carleson boxes.
- The Guth–Maynard results are **global** in height \(T\): bounds on \(N(\sigma,T)\) and on frequencies of large values along \([0,T]\).

So the mapping is indirect:
- global bounds can sometimes be localized by considering differences \(N(\sigma,T_2)-N(\sigma,T_1)\),
- but the resulting local constants typically depend on how close the exponent in \(T\) is to 1 and on any hidden \(o(1)\).

### Can this discharge a blocker?

#### Best-case use
- **Supports “far-right” control**: for any fixed \(\sigma\) where the exponent \(\theta(\sigma)=15(1-\sigma)/(3+5\sigma)\) is < 1 (e.g. \(\sigma\ge 0.6\) gives \(\theta\le 1\), and \(\sigma>0.6\) gives \(\theta<1\)),
  the global bound is consistent with **at most linear growth** of the number of such zeros in short height intervals.
- **Provides the best modern large-value toolkit** that could be relevant if B2′ is ultimately proved via a “large values / energy / renormalization” pipeline.

#### What remains missing (core gap)
- The result is not in a form that immediately implies our **uniform, local** Carleson packing statement for the σ-weighted measure near \(\Re(s)=1/2\).
- Theorem 1.2 is also **not explicit** (it has \(o(1)\)), which makes it hard to turn into a clean, reusable lemma with fixed constants of the type Lean likes.

### Actionable extraction for us

- **Written proof**:
  - Use as the strongest current unconditional reference behind statements like “we can control zeros with \(\Re(\rho)\ge 3/4\)” (or whatever range is relevant).
  - If we decide to split μ into regimes (near vs far from \(1/2\)), Guth–Maynard is a natural citation for the **far** regime.
- **Lean**:
  - If we want Lean-facing assumptions closer to known results, we could introduce a second predicate (besides `MuCarleson`) that is a **global zero-density hypothesis** (a function bound on \(N(\sigma,T)\)) and then prove a lemma that “global zero density in a far-right range ⇒ Carleson for μ restricted to that far-right range”.

---

### Verdict

- **High-value background and best-in-class tools** for modern zero-density/large-values technology.
- **Not directly plug-and-play** for `MuCarleson` / `OscillationTargetTail`, but likely part of any realistic number-theory attack on B2′.
