### Suzuki (arXiv:2301.05779) — “Li coefficients as norms of functions in a model space”

- **Citation**: Masatoshi Suzuki, *Li coefficients as norms of functions in a model space*, arXiv:2301.05779.
- **Primary relevance**: **Route 3 (explicit formula / Weil–Li positivity)**; gives a **Hilbert-space / model-space realization** of Li coefficients that conceptually matches our `SesqMeasureIdentity` / `ReflectionPositivityRealization` targets.

### What the paper actually proves (key statements)

#### Theorem 1.1 (RH iff Li coefficients are \(L^2(\mathbb R)\)-norm squares of explicit functions)
The paper defines explicit functions \(G_n:\mathbb R\to\mathbb C\) (built from \(\xi\) via formulas labelled (1.6) and (1.7) in the paper), and proves:
- \(G_n\in L^2(\mathbb R)\) **unconditionally** (proved later as Proposition 2.2).
- A necessary and sufficient condition for the Riemann Hypothesis is that an identity of the form
  \[
  \lambda_n \;=\; \frac{1}{2\pi}\,\|G_n\|_{L^2(\mathbb R)}^2
  \]
  holds for all positive integers \(n\).

(The PDF text extraction loses some formula formatting, but the “Li coefficient = constant × \(L^2\)-norm squared” content is explicit and central.)

#### Model-space/de Branges structure under RH
Assuming RH, the vectors \(G_n\) lie in a **model space** \(K_\Theta\subset L^2(\mathbb R)\) for a meromorphic inner function \(\Theta\) (upper half-plane model space theory).
This connects the picture to **de Branges spaces** and to Lagarias-style Hilbert-space frameworks.

### Mapping to our framework (Lean + manuscript)

#### Where this matches our Lean targets
- In our Route 3 infrastructure:
  - `HilbertRealization.lean` shows: **once** we have a positive semidefinite Hermitian form / sesquilinear measure identity, the Hilbert space realization is “mechanical”.
  - `CayleyBridge.lean` packages the hard RH-equivalent bridge as an axiom/goal.
- Suzuki provides a **concrete Hilbert model** (a subspace of \(L^2(\mathbb R)\)) in which **(a family of) Weil–Li objects** become norms.

This is close in spirit to our desired statement:
\[
W^{(1)}(\mathrm{pair}(f,g)) \;=\; \langle F_f, F_g\rangle_{L^2(\mu)}
\]
except Suzuki focuses on the special sequence \(f\mapsto \lambda_n\) rather than the full sesquilinear pairing for an abstract test space \(F\).

#### Why it still leaves the main gap
Suzuki’s key identity is **RH-equivalent**:
- “RH ⇒ norm identity” uses the inner/model-space structure.
- “norm identity ⇒ RH” is the nontrivial direction (exactly the kind of “splice identity / positivity realization” gap we have in `CayleyBridgeAssumptions`).

So this does not magically circumvent the splice-completion identity; it reframes it.

### Can this discharge a blocker?

#### Best-case use
- **Route 3 target-shaping**: suggests an alternative intermediate target that might be easier to formalize than the full `SesqMeasureIdentity`:
  - build a Lean representation of Li coefficients \(\lambda_n\) as \(L^2\)-norms in an explicitly defined Hilbert space;
  - then prove that “this representation for all \(n\)” implies RH.
- **Conceptual alignment**: strengthens confidence that the Route 3 “Hilbert realization” story is compatible with existing operator/model-space technology (Lagarias/de Branges lineage).

#### What remains missing
- A proof of the RH-equivalent bridge itself (still the hard part).
- A mapping from Suzuki’s model-space objects \((\Theta, K_\Theta, G_n)\) into our existing Lean interfaces:
  - `LagariasFramework` test functions,
  - `PSCSplice` spectral identity / `CayleyBridgeAssumptions`.

---

### Actionable extraction for us

- **Written proof**:
  - cite Suzuki as a recent source reframing Li positivity into a **concrete \(L^2(\mathbb R)\) norm identity**, which is exactly the “reflection positivity realization” flavor.
- **Lean**:
  - we can add a “Route 3 alt-bridge” file that defines the Suzuki-style Hilbert space target (model space / \(L^2\) subspace) and shows it implies `OptionalTargets.ReflectionPositivityRealization` *if assumed*.
  - This would not prove RH, but it could give a much more concrete *typed* intermediate goal than the current abstract `bridge_to_measure`.

---

### Verdict

- **Most directly relevant paper in the shortlist for Route 3 conceptual work**.
- **Does not resolve the RH-equivalent analytic gap**, but offers a potentially more formalization-friendly intermediate target and connects strongly to de Branges/Lagarias technology.
