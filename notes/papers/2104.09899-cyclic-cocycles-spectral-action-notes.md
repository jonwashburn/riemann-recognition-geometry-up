### Cyclic cocycles in the spectral action (arXiv:2104.09899v2)

- **Citation**: Teun D.H. van Nuland, Walter D. van Suijlekom, *Cyclic cocycles in the spectral action*, `arXiv:2104.09899v2` (dated 2022-09-19 in the PDF; arXiv submission 2021-04-20).
- **One-line relevance**: Provides analytic technology (multiple operator integrals, absolute convergence conditions) for expanding the **spectral action** `Tr(f(D+V))`; it is adjacent to the “spectral action” side of the Connes/van Suijlekom story, but it does **not** directly address the RH-critical missing step in the Connes Route‑3′ program (determinant/approximant convergence to `Ξ`).

#### Results to extract (what it actually proves)
- **R1 (MOI-based Taylor expansions of the spectral action)**:
  - Develops a framework to express `Tr(f(D+V)) - Tr(f(D))` in terms of higher-order multilinear functionals built from multiple operator integrals (MOIs).
  - Reorganizes the expansion by form-degree in a universal 1-form \(A\), yielding a decomposition into generalized Chern–Simons and Yang–Mills terms of all orders.
- **R2 (cyclic/Hochschild cocycles extracted from the expansion)**:
  - Identifies an even family of Hochschild cocycles \((\varphi_{2k})\) and a genuinely infinite odd \((b,B)\)-cocycle \((\\tilde\\psi_{2k+1})\), derived from the divided-difference/Taylor data of the MOIs.
- **R3 (convergence/entire cocycle criteria)**:
  - Gives conditions (in the \(s\)-summable spectral triple setting) under which the cocycles are “entire” and the expansion is absolutely convergent.
- **R4 (pairing with \(K_1\) vanishes)**:
  - Uses gauge invariance to show the odd \((b,B)\)-cocycle pairs trivially with \(K_1\).

#### Mapping to our blockers
- **Route 3 / PSC splice identity**: no direct effect.
- **Connes Route‑3′ (determinant approximants)**:
  - Indirect adjacency only: `arXiv:2511.23257` mentions “echoes of the spectral action” and studies truncation matrices whose structure appears in perturbative spectral-action expansions.
  - This paper explains how such expansions arise and gives analytic estimates for convergence **of spectral-action expansions**, but does not provide convergence of the *zeta spectral triple determinants* to `Ξ`.

#### Verdict
- **Useful background** if we want to justify why certain truncation-matrix structures are “natural” from spectral action / MOI theory.
- **Not a direct discharge** of any current written-proof blocker or Lean proof hole.
