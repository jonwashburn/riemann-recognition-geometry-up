### From Bernoulli Numbers to Selector Kernels: Fredholm Determinants, ζ-Regularization, and the Bridge Between Discrete and Continuous Spectra (arXiv:2511.07495v1)

- **Citation**: Ken Nagai, *From Bernoulli Numbers to Selector Kernels: Fredholm Determinants, ζ-Regularization, and the Bridge Between Discrete and Continuous Spectra*, `arXiv:2511.07495v1` (submitted 2025-11-10).
- **One-line relevance**: Discusses ζ-regularized determinants and Fredholm determinants for *trigonometric selector kernels* and the sine-kernel/Painlevé‑V story; this is adjacent “determinant technology” but does **not** connect to zeta zeros / the Riemann ξ-function in a way that would discharge our Route‑3 or Route‑3′ blockers.

#### What it actually proves
- Develops a narrative bridge between:
  - Euler–Maclaurin / Bernoulli corrections for sums,
  - ζ-regularized determinants for spectral products,
  - Fredholm determinants for trace-class operators and kernels,
  culminating in the sine-kernel Fredholm determinant as a Painlevé‑V τ-function (Tracy–Widom).

#### Assumptions / caveats
- The paper is written as a broad “bridging exposition” (per its own abstract/comments).
- There is no specific operator producing zeta zeros, no RH-equivalent statement, and no convergence-to-`Ξ` mechanism.

#### Mapping to our framework
- **Potential superficial overlap**:
  - The Connes Route‑3′ program uses regularized determinants of operators and wants locally-uniform convergence of entire functions.
  - This paper discusses ζ-determinants/Fredholm determinants in general operator settings.
- **But missing the key bridge**:
  - No identification of a determinant with the Riemann ξ/Ξ function.
  - No analytic number theory content that would help the PSC splice identity or μ-Carleson bottlenecks.

#### Verdict
- **Drop / background only**: not directly useful for the written proof blockers or for Lean proof-hole discharge.
