### Chourasiya (arXiv:2412.02068) — “An explicit version of Carlson’s [zero density] theorem”

- **Citation**: (As extracted) Chourasiya, *An explicit version of Carlson’s bound* (arXiv:2412.02068).
- **Primary relevance**: **B2′ / μ-Carleson (supporting only moderately far-right zeros)**; gives an explicit bound for \(N(\sigma,T)\) for **\(\sigma \ge 0.6\)**.

### What the paper actually proves (key statements)

#### Theorem 1.1 (explicit Carlson-type density bound)
For \(T \ge T_0 \ge 3\cdot 10^{12}\) and \(\sigma \ge 0.6\), the estimate
\[
N(\sigma,T) \le K(\sigma,T_0)\, T^{\,4\sigma(1-\sigma)}\, (\log T)^{\,5-2\sigma}
\]
holds (with \(K(\sigma,T_0)\) defined explicitly in the paper; they tabulate values for several \((\sigma,T_0)\)).

The paper’s abstract also highlights an **absolute-constant** version (still restricted to the same \(\sigma,T\) range):
\[
N(\sigma,T) \le 0.78\;T^{4\sigma(1-\sigma)}(\log T)^{5-2\sigma},
\]
stated as “an explicit version of Carlson’s estimate”.

Here \(N(\sigma,T)\) is the standard zero counting function (zeros \(\rho=\beta+i\gamma\) of \(\zeta\) with \(\beta\ge\sigma\), \(|\gamma|\le T\), counted with multiplicity).

### Mapping to our framework (Lean + manuscript)

- This controls zeros with **\(\beta \ge 0.6\)**, i.e. with our vertical coordinate \(\sigma'=\beta-\tfrac12 \ge 0.1\).
- These are “far” from the critical line in the B2′ sense, and (if they exist at all) are heavily penalized by our μ-weight \(\sigma'\).

---

### Can this discharge a blocker?

#### Best-case use
- Because the exponent \(4\sigma(1-\sigma)\) is **< 1** for every \(\sigma>1/2\) and in particular for \(\sigma\ge 0.6\) (max is \(0.96\) at \(\sigma=0.6\)),
  one can in principle **localize** the global bound to get a uniform-in-height bound on the number of such zeros in any short height interval of length \(H\):
  \[
  \#\{\rho:\ \beta\ge\sigma,\ T-H<|\gamma|\le T\}\ \ll_{\sigma,T_0}\ H.
  \]
  (The log factor does not automatically break uniformity because \(T^{0.96-1}(\log T)^{5-2\sigma}\) decays for large \(T\); the worst case occurs near the minimal height \(T_0\).)
- So, like Bellotti, this can support a “**far-right zeros are not the obstruction**” narrative and can be used to carve out an “easy regime” for μ.

#### What remains missing (core gap)
- This does **not** control zeros with \(\beta = 1/2 + u\) for small \(u\) (equivalently \(\sigma' = u\ll 1\)), which is the regime that matters for:
  - `MuCarleson muOffCritical Cμ α` (all Whitney bases, including tiny ones),
  - and thus the axiomatized bridge `oscillationTargetTail_of_muCarleson`.

---

### Actionable extraction for us

- **Written proof**: cite as an explicit, constructive bound for \(\sigma\ge0.6\), to justify that any remaining μ-Carleson/B2′ obstruction must come from \(\sigma\) close to \(1/2\).
- **Lean**: optional future refactor to split μ into regimes:
  - `μ_far : μ restricted to σ' ≥ 0.1` (could be treated as “known Carleson” via explicit literature bounds),
  - `μ_near : μ restricted to σ' < 0.1` (the hard RH-equivalent regime).

Concrete Lean integration point:
- The “far regime” just described is exactly the complement of `sigmaLeSet δ` with `δ = 0.1`:
  - `sigmaLeSet 0.1 = { (t,σ') | σ' ≤ 0.1 }`
  - far = `(sigmaLeSet 0.1)ᶜ = {σ' > 0.1}`.
- This feeds the Route‑A split scaffold in `RiemannRecognitionGeometry/ZeroDensityAssumptions.lean`
  as an intended input to the stub `muCarleson_far_of_zeroDensity_at`.

---

### Verdict

- **Useful as support** for bounding the contribution of zeros with \(\beta\ge0.6\).
- **Not sufficient** to prove μ-Carleson/B2′ in the small-\(\sigma'\) (near-critical-line) regime.
