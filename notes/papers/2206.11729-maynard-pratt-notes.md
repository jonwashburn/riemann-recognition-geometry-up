### Maynard–Pratt (arXiv:2206.11729v2) — “Half-isolated zeros and zero-density estimates”

- **Citation**: James Maynard, Kyle Pratt, *Half-isolated zeros and zero-density estimates*, arXiv:2206.11729v2 (v2; page shows 2023 submission for this version).
- **Primary relevance**: **B2′ / μ-Carleson (structure-side)**. This paper is unusual in that it is explicitly sensitive to the **vertical/local clustering** of zeta zeros (via “half-isolated” zeros + clusters), which is closer in spirit to the kind of “local packing” control we want than a pure global \(N(\sigma,T)\) exponent table.

### What the paper actually proves (key statements)

#### Hypothesis F (rigidity hypothesis; conditional)
They introduce a rigidity assumption:
- **Hypothesis F**: the nontrivial zeros of \(\zeta(s)\) lie on a **finite number of fixed vertical lines**.

#### Theorem 1 (conditional near–Density Hypothesis under Hypothesis F)
Assuming Hypothesis F:
\[
N(\sigma,T)\ \ll\ T^{2(1-\sigma)}\,\exp\!\big((\log\log T)^{O(1)}\big).
\]
So under strong rigidity, they get a near–Density-Hypothesis-strength bound (up to a subpolynomial factor).

#### Theorem 4 (unconditional): half-isolated zeros have *short* zero-detecting polynomials
They define “half-isolated” zeros (Definitions 8–9; roughly: zeros whose nearby zeros are vertically above and have real parts very close).
Unconditionally:
- If \(\rho_0=\beta_0+i\gamma_0\) is half-isolated with \(\gamma_0\in[T,2T]\), then there exists a parameter
  \[
  Y \in \Big[T(\log\log T)^3/\log T,\ \ T^{1/5}/\log\log T\Big]
  \]
  such that a **very short Dirichlet polynomial** (built from \(\Lambda(n)\) with a smooth cutoff \(w_0(n/Y)\)) takes a **large value** at \(\rho_0\).
  (The extracted text records the existence of an absolute constant \(C\) and the inequality in the form “sum \(\ge (\log T)^{-C}\)”.)

Precise definitions from the paper (as extracted from the PDF text):

- **Definition 8 (Y-half-isolated)**: for real \(Y>1\), a zero \(\rho_0=\beta_0+i\gamma_0\) is **Y-half-isolated** if **every** zero \(\rho'=\beta'+i\gamma'\) with
  \[
    |\rho'-\rho_0|\le (\log|\gamma_0|)^2
  \]
  satisfies at least one of:
  - **(1) similar real part + vertically above**:
    \[
      |\beta'-\beta_0|\le \frac{1}{10\log Y}\quad\text{and}\quad \gamma'\ge \gamma_0;
    \]
  - **(2) smaller real part**:
    \[
      \beta' \le \beta_0-\frac{(\log\log|\gamma_0|)^2}{\log Y}.
    \]

- **Definition 9 (half-isolated)**: \(\rho_0\) is **half-isolated** if it is Y-half-isolated for some \(Y\) with
  \[
    (\log\log|\gamma_0|)^3 \le \log Y \le \frac{\log|\gamma_0|}{\log\log|\gamma_0|}.
  \]

And their heuristic “typical” regime (also explicitly stated):
- for \(\gamma_0\in[T,2T]\) and \(Y\approx T^{1/\log\log T}\),
  any zero within \((\log T)^2\) of \(\rho_0\) must satisfy either
  \[
    \beta \le \beta_0-\frac{(\log\log T)^3}{\log T},
  \]
  or
  \[
    |\beta-\beta_0|\le \frac{\log\log T}{10\log T}\ \ \text{and}\ \ \gamma\ge \gamma_0.
  \]

#### Corollary 5 (unconditional): half-isolated zeros satisfy Density Hypothesis
As a consequence of Theorem 4 + large-values technology:
- the number of half-isolated zeros to the right of \(\Re(s)=\sigma\) in \([T,2T]\) is \(\le T^{2(1-\sigma)+o(1)}\).

#### Paper-level limitation (explicitly acknowledged)
They say they **cannot currently exploit** the half-isolated zero technology to obtain an *unconditional* improvement to the full \(N(\sigma,T)\) bounds; they identify vertical arithmetic progressions/clustering as key obstructions (see their discussion around Section 8).

### Mapping to our framework (Lean + manuscript)

#### Our B2′ / μ-Carleson target
In Lean, the “number theory input” we want to isolate is:
- `MuCarleson muOffCritical Cμ α` (uniform local Carleson packing in every Carleson box), feeding
- `oscillationTargetTail_of_muCarleson` (axiom stub) → `OscillationTargetTail`.

This paper’s unconditional results are not a Carleson packing statement, but they are **structural**:
- It provides a mechanism that converts a **local/vertical configuration** (“half-isolated”) into the existence of **short zero-detecting polynomials**,
- and therefore into rarity of such configurations via large-value bounds.

So the most plausible “bridge direction” is:

> “If μ-Carleson fails badly, it forces a lot of locally rigid/one-sided configurations in Whitney windows; those look ‘half-isolated’ enough to trigger Maynard–Pratt; hence contradiction.”

But this bridge is **not in the paper**, and matching their “(log T)^3 clustering windows” geometry to our **Whitney/Carleson box geometry** is nontrivial.

---

### Can this discharge a blocker?

#### Best-case use
- Provides a **new intermediate target** that is more local/structural than \(N(\sigma,T)\):
  - control (or classify) vertical clustering patterns of off-critical zeros in local windows,
  - then apply “half-isolated ⇒ rare” to rule out certain bad configurations.
- Could inform a future Lean-facing predicate that sits *between* “raw \(N(\sigma,T)\)” and “μ-Carleson”, e.g.:
  - “no long vertical arithmetic progressions / no tall rigid clusters in Whitney windows”.

#### What remains missing (core gap)
- No direct implication to the **uniform local** `MuCarleson` predicate.
- The strongest density bound (Theorem 1) is **conditional** on Hypothesis F, which is much stronger than anything we are willing to assume in our RH-level argument.

---

### Actionable extraction for us

- **Written proof**: cite this paper as evidence that *vertical-local structure* is the genuine obstruction to improving zero-density bounds, aligning with why B2′ is framed as a **local renormalized** certificate rather than a global BMO statement.
- **Lean**: consider adding an optional intermediate hypothesis (future work) expressing “no bad local vertical clustering” and documenting that Maynard–Pratt implies rarity of one such bad pattern class.

---

### Verdict

- **Helpful conceptually/strategically** for B2′: it strengthens the case that a successful μ-Carleson/B2′ attack likely needs *local structure control*, not just global \(N(\sigma,T)\) exponents.
- **Not a direct plug-in** to discharge `MuCarleson` or `OscillationTargetTail` in Lean.
