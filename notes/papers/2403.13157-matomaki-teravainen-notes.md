### What the paper actually proves (key statements)

#### Theorem 1.2 (zero density ⇒ large value estimates)
For \(\varepsilon>0\), \(\nu\in[0,1/2]\), and \(T\ge 1\), there exists \(C=C(\varepsilon)\) such that the measure of \(t\in[-T,T]\) for which there exists a Dirichlet polynomial window \((M,M']\) with
\[
\Big|\sum_{M<m\le M'} \frac{1}{m^{1+it}}\Big| \ \ge\ M^{-\nu}
\]
is bounded by a quantity of the form
\[
\ll_{\varepsilon}\ T^{\varepsilon}\,\max_{1-\nu-\varepsilon \le \alpha \le 1}
M^{\alpha-(1-\nu)}\,N(\alpha, C T)\;+\;T^{\nu/2+\varepsilon},
\]
where \(N(\alpha,CT)\) is the standard zeta zero counting function in the half-plane \(\Re(\rho)\ge \alpha\).

(The extracted PDF text is formula-heavy; the above is the structural content of their Theorem 1.2.)

### Mapping to our framework (Lean + manuscript)

This paper is not directly about Carleson packing, but it **connects**:
- **zero density inputs** \(N(\alpha,T)\) (global information about zeros off the critical line),
to
- **large values frequency bounds** for certain Dirichlet polynomials on \([-T,T]\).

In the Recognition Geometry “B2′” story, this could matter because:
- `tailLogAbs` is (morally) \(\log|\xi(1/2+it)|\) minus a local potential built from zeros,
- and many approaches to controlling oscillation/BMO for \(\log|\zeta|\) pass through
  control of Dirichlet polynomial approximants and their large-value sets.

---

### Can this discharge a blocker?

#### Best-case use
- If we had (or assume) a **stronger zero density statement** in the near-\(1/2\) regime, this paper provides a ready-made pipeline to convert it into **large-values control** for specific Dirichlet polynomials.
- Those large-values bounds are a plausible ingredient in a future proof of a localized oscillation/BMO statement like `OscillationTargetTail`.

#### What remains missing (core gap)
- This is a *reduction mechanism*, not a new zero density bound, and it does not by itself yield:
  - `MuCarleson muOffCritical Cμ α`, or
  - `InBMOWithBoundOnWhitney (tailLogAbs ...)`.
- Any attempt to use it in B2′ would still need:
  - a precise identification of the relevant Dirichlet polynomial approximants for our `tailLogAbs`,
  - and a clean “large-values ⇒ BMO on Whitney intervals” lemma.

### Actionable extraction for us

- **Written proof**:
  - cite this as evidence that “if we can prove the right kind of zero density bound, then the large-values side becomes accessible”, aligning with the RG renormalization narrative.
- **Lean** (future):
  - consider adding an intermediate hypothesis/predicate between `MuCarleson` and `OscillationTargetTail`:
    - a large-values frequency bound for a family of Dirichlet polynomials approximating `logAbsXi`,
    - then prove `MuCarleson ⇒ (large-values bound) ⇒ OscillationTargetTail`.

---

### Verdict

- **Helpful structurally** (it clarifies what a “number theory input” could buy us).
- **Not directly discharging** any current Lean axiom/hole, but informs a realistic decomposition of B2′.
