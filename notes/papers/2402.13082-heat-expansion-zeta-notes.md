### Heat Expansion and Zeta (arXiv:2402.13082v1)

- **Citation**: Alain Connes, *Heat Expansion and Zeta*, `arXiv:2402.13082v1` (submitted 2024-02-20).
- **One-line relevance**: Operator/trace-formula motivation: assuming RH and assuming the existence of a self-adjoint “zero-spectrum operator” \(D\), Connes computes the full small-\(t\) heat-trace expansion \(\mathrm{Tr}(e^{-tD^2})\) using the Riemann–Weil explicit formula, and relates the divergent terms to the prolate-wave-operator Dirac square-root heat expansion.

#### Results to extract
- **R1 (explicit full heat expansion, RH-conditional)**: Under RH, for the self-adjoint operator \(D\) with spectrum equal to the imaginary parts of nontrivial zeta zeros, Connes gives an explicit asymptotic expansion
  \[
  \mathrm{Tr}(e^{-tD^2}) \sim \tfrac{\sqrt{\pi}}{4\sqrt t}\log(1/t)\;-\;(\log(4\pi)+\tfrac12\gamma)\tfrac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2\sqrt t}\;+\;2e^{t/4} + \sum a_n t^{n/2},
  \]
  with coefficients \(a_n\) given in closed form via Bernoulli and Euler numbers. (Theorem 1.1)
- **R2 (counting-function ⇒ first heat terms)**: If an operator \(D\) has even discrete spectrum and counting function
  \(N(E)=\#(\mathrm{Spec}\,D \cap [0,E]) = \frac{E}{2\pi}\log\!\left(\frac{E}{2\pi}\right) - \frac{E}{2\pi} + O(\log E)\),
  then the leading \(\sqrt t^{-1}\log(1/t)\) and \(\sqrt t^{-1}\) terms of \(\mathrm{Tr}(e^{-tD^2})\) follow. (Theorem 5.1)
- **R3 (explicit formula split)**: The computation is explicitly organized as “archimedean contribution + prime contribution”, starting from the Riemann–Weil explicit formulas (Section 2–4).

#### Assumptions / caveats
- **A1 (RH is assumed)**: The central operator \(D\) is only self-adjoint if zeros lie on the critical line; the entire computation is **conditional on RH**.
- **A2 (does not produce a new RH route)**: The paper extracts spectral/heat information *given* RH; it doesn’t give a method to prove RH or the splice identity.

#### Mapping to our framework
- **Maps to (Route 3 operator vision)**:
  - supports the *operator-first* mindset behind `RiemannRecognitionGeometry/ExplicitFormula/OperatorSpectralMeasureBridge.lean` (operator identities ⇒ spectral measures ⇒ integral identities).
  - highlights a canonical **test family** \(f_t\) (heat kernels) that could be used to probe the Weil pairing / explicit formula in a single-parameter way.
- **Not a direct fit**:
  - it does not identify a measure-first `SesqMeasureIntegralIdentity` for `W¹(pair f g)`; instead it computes a specific trace assuming the “zero-spectrum operator” already exists.

#### Can it discharge a blocker?
- **Best case**: only indirect—provides operator/trace-formula heuristics and a worked example showing how explicit formula data feeds a heat trace, which could guide a future operator-based splice attempt.
- **Verdict**: **Motivational / structural**; not a direct discharge of any current written or Lean proof hole.

#### Next actions
- **Written proof**: cite as supporting evidence that the operator/heat-kernel viewpoint is coherent *given RH* (if you want motivational context near the prolate-wave-operator discussion).
- **Lean**: no immediate new axioms to replace; at most, consider adding an optional “heat-kernel test family” lemma in the Route 3 narrative (non-essential).
