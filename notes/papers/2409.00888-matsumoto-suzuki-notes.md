### Matsumoto–Suzuki (arXiv:2409.00888v2) — “\(M\)-functions and screw functions … zeros of the Riemann zeta function”

- **Citation**: Kohji Matsumoto, Masatoshi Suzuki, *\(M\)-functions and screw functions originating from Goldbach's problem and zeros of the Riemann zeta function*, arXiv:2409.00888v2. (Journal reference listed on arXiv page: *J. Number Theory* 280 (2026), 918–946.)
- **Primary relevance**: **Route 3 (positivity/kernels ⇔ RH)** and “Suzuki screw-function technology”. This paper gives multiple **RH-equivalent** reformulations:
  - via **\(M\)-functions / value distribution** formulas (under RH + LI),
  - via **screw-function kernel positivity** (an *iff* with RH for a specific \(g(t)\)).

### What the paper actually proves (key statements)

#### Setup: two zero-sums \(H(X)\), \(H_1(X)\)
The paper studies explicit sums over zeta zeros that define functions \(H(X)\) and a variant \(H_1(X)\) (the precise formulas are in the introduction; roughly of the form \(\sum_\rho X^{\rho-1/2}/(\rho(1-\rho))\) etc).

#### Theorem 1.1 (RH + LI ⇒ \(M\)-function / limiting distribution for \(H(e^t)\))
Assuming:
- **RH**, and
- **linear independence over \(\mathbb Q\)** of the set of positive imaginary parts of nontrivial zeros,

there exists an explicitly constructible density \(M_H:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R_{\ge 0}\) such that for any locally Riemann integrable test function \(\Phi\),
\[
\lim_{T\to\infty}\frac{1}{T}\int_0^T \Phi(H(e^t))\,dt
\;=\;
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{\mathbb R} M_H(u)\,\Phi(u)\,du.
\]
They record that \(M_H\) is continuous, nonnegative, compactly supported, and integrates to 1.

#### Theorem 1.2 (compact-support \(M\)-function formula ⇒ RH)
If the “\(M\)-function formula” (as above) holds with a **compactly supported** continuous \(M_H\) for all locally Riemann integrable \(\Phi\), then \(H(X)\) is bounded, hence **RH holds**.

This is an explicit “distributional formula ⇒ boundedness ⇒ RH” direction.

#### Theorem 1.3 (screw-function characterization ⇔ RH)
Define
\[
g_{H_1}(t) := H_1(e^t) - H_1(1).
\]
Then:
- \(g_{H_1}\) is a **screw function** on \(\mathbb R\) **iff RH holds**.

They recall the definition: a continuous even \(g\) is a screw function iff the kernel
\[
G_g(t,u) := g(t-u) - g(t) - g(-u) + g(0)
\]
is **nonnegative definite** on \(\mathbb R\times\mathbb R\).

#### Theorem 1.4 (RH + LI ⇒ an infinitely divisible law with an explicit atom via the \(M\)-function)
Under RH + LI, they relate the screw-function exponential \(\exp(y g_{H_1}(t))\) to an infinitely divisible distribution \(\mu_y\), and compute the point mass at 0:
\[
\mu_y(\{0\}) = e^{-yH_1(1)}\,\widehat{M}_{H_1}(-iy)
             = e^{-yH_1(1)} \prod_{\gamma>0}\Big(\frac{2iy\,m_\gamma}{1/4+\gamma^2}\Big),
\]
where \(\widehat{M}_{H_1}\) is the Fourier transform of the \(M\)-function density.

### Mapping to our framework (Lean + manuscript)

#### Why this is Route‑3 aligned
Theorem 1.3 is particularly “RG/Route‑3 shaped”:
- it converts RH into **nonnegative definiteness** of a kernel \(G_g\),
which is the same *mathematical type* as:
- “reflection positivity / positive kernel / Hilbert space realization” (our Route‑3 goal packaging in `ExplicitFormula/CayleyBridge.lean` and `HilbertRealization.lean`).

So while it doesn’t give an unconditional bridge, it suggests:
- an alternate RH-equivalent target might be: **exhibit an explicit kernel \(K(t,u)\) that equals \(G_{H_1}(t,u)\) and prove it is PSD** (or identify it as a Gram kernel in an \(L^2(\mu)\) model).

#### Why it doesn’t automatically close our Lean gaps
- The main results are RH-equivalent (and some require RH+LI).
- The paper does not directly provide the PSC/J(s) “splice completion spectral identity” we need for the current Route‑3 chain.
- Lean currently has no `screw function`/`M-function` interfaces; we would need to introduce new typed targets (similar to `ExplicitFormula/SuzukiBridge.lean`) if we decide this is a better bridge surface.

---

### Actionable extraction for us

- **Written proof**:
  - cite Theorem 1.3 as a modern, clean RH-equivalent “kernel positivity” formulation closely aligned with reflection-positivity language.
  - use Theorems 1.1/1.2/1.4 to justify that “boundedness/compact-support distribution laws” are essentially RH-level.

- **Lean (optional target-shaping)**:
  - add an alternate Route‑3 intermediate target file defining:
    - a function `g : ℝ → ℝ` and its kernel `Gg : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ`,
    - a predicate `IsNonnegDefKernel Gg`,
    - and a theorem “`IsNonnegDefKernel Gg` ⇒ RH” (mirroring Theorem 1.3’s direction).

---

### Verdict

- **Helpful for Route‑3 target shaping**, especially if we want a *kernel positivity* bridge rather than only the PSC/J(s) splice identity.
- **Not a direct solver** for our current Lean proof-holes, but strongly compatible with the “reflection positivity” direction.
