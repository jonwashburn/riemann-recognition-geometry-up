Zeta Spectral Triples

Alain Connes, Caterina Consani and Henri Moscovici

Abstract

We propose and investigate a strategy toward a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis based on
a spectral realization of its non-trivial zeros. Our approach constructs self-adjoint operators
D(λ,N )
obtained as rank-one perturbations of the spectral triple associated with the scaling
log
operator on the interval [λ−1, λ]. The construction only involves the Euler products over the
primes p ≤ x = λ2 and produces self-adjoint operators whose spectra coincide, with striking
numerical accuracy, with the lowest non-trivial zeros of ζ( 1
2 + is), even for small values of x. The
theoretical foundation rests on the framework introduced in [4] together with the extension in [7]
of the classical Carath´eodory–Fej´er theorem for Toeplitz matrices, which guarantees the necessary
self-adjointness. Numerical experiments show that the spectra of the operators D(λ,N )
converge
towards the zeros of ζ( 1
2 + is) as the parameters N, λ → ∞. A rigorous proof of this convergence
would establish the Riemann Hypothesis. We further compute the regularized determinants
detreg(D(λ,N )
log − z) of these operators and discuss the analytic role they play in controlling and
potentially proving the above result by showing that, suitably normalized, they converge towards
the Riemann Ξ function.

Introduction

This paper is motivated by the spectral realization initiated in [4] of the low lying zeros of the
Riemann zeta function, in other words as the infrared part of the spectrum of a selfadjoint operator.
Another key ingredient is the generalization proved in [7] of a fundamental result on Toeplitz
matrices which is a corollary of Carath´eodory-Fejer 1911 structure theorem [2]. This generalization
provides for us a large class of functions whose zeros are located on the critical line ℜ(s) = 1/2
due to the selfadjointness of relevant matrices and the Hurwitz theorem on zeros of uniform limits
of holomorphic functions. With these tools at hand one devises a process, perfectly in line with
Riemann’s paper [10], which associates to the restricted Euler product involving only the primes
p ≤ x a function whose zeros are on the critical line.
The great surprise then, is that the zeros of this function give high-precision approximations to the
first non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function using remarkably few terms of the Euler product.
For instance using only the primes ≤ 13 one obtains for the first 50 zeros an extraordinary accuracy,

with errors ranging from 2.5 × 10−55 for the first zero to approximately 10−3 for the fiftieth. The
probability of achieving such precise approximations by chance is approximately 10−1235, effectively
ruling out coincidence and suggesting a deep structural relationship between the restricted Euler
products and the location of the zeros. The method we use is general as well as the proof that all
the approximating values lie exactly on the critical line.
In fact we construct spectral triples associated to rank one perturbations D(λ,N )
of the scaling
operator D(λ)
log on the interval [λ−1, λ] with periodic boundary conditions. This construction is based
on the restriction QW N
λ of the Weil quadratic form to the linear space EN = EN (λ) of test functions
spanned by the 2N + 1 eigenfunctions of D(λ)
log associated to the 2N + 1 eigenvalues of smallest
absolute value (i.e. ≤ N π/ log λ), extended by 0 outside the interval [λ−1, λ]. We need to verify that
the smallest eigenvalue ϵN of QW N
λ is simple and that the corresponding eigenfunction is ”even” i.e.
invariant under the symmetry u (cid:55)→ u−1. We let δN ∈ EN be the vector representing the Dirichlet
kernel, as an approximation to the evaluation on the boundary of the interval [λ−1, λ]. Our main
result is the following:

information theory, as developed through the theory of prolate wave functions by D. Slepian and
his collaborators [15].

2 Preliminaries

2.1 The Banach algebra L1(R, dx)

In this section we shall explain elementary computations preparing the ground for the introduction
of the Weil quadratic form QWλ and of the matrix encoding this quadratic form in a natural basis.

3

2.2 The basis {Un}n∈Z

Definition 2.1. We let L1(R, dx) be the involutive complex Banach algebra of complex valued
integrable functions on R with product and involution given by

(cid:90)

f ∗ g(y) :=

f (x)g(y − x)dx

f ∗(y) := f (−y)

(2.1)

(2.2)

We shall use the subalgebra of compactly supported functions. Both operations yield functions with
compact support. We consider the inclusion L2([0, L]) ⊂ L1(R, dx) obtained by extending functions
by 0 outside the interval [0, L]. In particular, for f, g ∈ L2[0, L] the support of f ∗ ∗ g is contained in
[−L, L].
We shall use inner products ⟨f, g⟩ which are antilinear in the first variable and linear in the second.
The standard inner product ⟨f, g⟩2 is given by

(cid:90)

⟨f, g⟩2 =

f (x)g(x)dx = (f ∗ ∗ g)(0)

In preparation for more involved inner products, we shall compute expressions of the form

q(f, g)(y) := (f ∗ ∗ g)(y) + (f ∗ ∗ g)(−y)

which is an even function of y depending antilinearly on f and linearly on g. One has

(f ∗ ∗ g)(−y) = (f ∗ ∗ g)∗(y) = (g∗ ∗ f )(y),

(2.3)

(2.4)

hence

q(f, g)(y) = (f ∗ ∗ g)(y) + (g∗ ∗ f )(y).

(2.5)

Let a ∈ R and for any f ∈ L1(R, dx), let fa(x) := f (x − a) denote the translated of f .

Lemma 2.2. For any a ∈ R, f, g ∈ L1(R, dx), one has (fa)∗ ∗ ga = f ∗ ∗ g and q(fa, ga) = q(f, g).

Proof. One has

(fa)∗ ∗ ga(y) =

(cid:90)

(fa)∗(y − x)ga(x)dx =

(cid:90)

=

(fa)(x − y)ga(x)dx =

(cid:90)

f (x − a − y)g(x − a)dx

which is independent of a. The second equality follows from (2.4).

2.2 The basis {Un}n∈Z

A natural orthonormal basis for L2([0, L]) consists of the functions {Un}n∈Z defined by

Un(x) := L− 1

2 exp(2πinx/L),

∀x ∈ [0, L].

(2.6)

4

2.2 The basis {Un}n∈Z

Applying the above operations to the basis functions one obtains, for n ̸= m, y ∈ [0, L],

(U ∗

m ∗ Un)(y) =

(cid:90)

Um(x − y)Un(x)dx =

=

exp(2πimy/L)

exp(2πimy/L) − exp(2πiny/L)
2πi(n − m)

so that for n ̸= m, y ∈ [0, L],

(U ∗

m ∗ Un)(y) =

exp(2πimy/L) − exp(2πiny/L)
2πi(n − m)

The result of (2.7) being symmetric in n, m, it implies using (2.5), that for y ∈ [0, L],

(U ∗

m ∗ Un)(y) + (U ∗

m ∗ Un)(−y) = 2 ℜ

(cid:32)

2πi(n − m)

(cid:33)

=

sin(2πmy/L) − sin(2πny/L)
π(n − m)

(2.7)

(2.8)

so that the even function q(Um, Un) is given by

q(Um, Un)(y) =

sin(2πm|y|/L) − sin(2πn|y|/L)
π(n − m)

, ∀y ∈ [−L, L].

(2.9)

For m = n one simply has, for y ∈ [0, L],

(U ∗

n ∗ Un)(y) =

1
L

(cid:90) L

y

exp(2πin(y − x)/L + 2πinx/L)dx = (1 − y/L) exp(2πiny/L),

whence

We thus get

(U ∗

n ∗ Un)(y) + (U ∗

n ∗ Un)(−y) = 2 ℜ ((1 − y/L) exp(2πiny/L)) =

= 2(1 − y/L) cos(2πny/L).

q(Un, Un)(y) = 2(1 − |y|/L) cos(2πny/L), ∀y ∈ [−L, L].

(2.10)

Lemma 2.3. The explicit expression of the even function q(Un, Um)(y) for y ∈ [0, L] is :

m ̸= n

m = n

sin( 2πmy

L )−sin( 2πny

3. The Weil quadratic form QW

3 The Weil quadratic form QW

The sesquilinear form QW derives from Weil’s formulation of the explicit formula in prime numbers
theory [16], which we recall below. Let us denote by W(R∗
+) the Weil class of complex valued
functions f on R∗
+, by which we mean the functions having continuous derivative, except at finitely
many points where both f (x) and f ′(x) may have at most a discontinuity of the first kind; at such
a point the value of f (x) and f ′(x) is defined as the average of the right and left limits. In addition,
the functions f ∈ W (R∗

+) are assumed to satisfy the estimate

f (x) = O(xδ), for x → 0+, f (x) = O(x−1−δ), for x → +∞,

for some δ > 0. These functions admit a Mellin transform, denoted

˜f (s) :=

(cid:90) ∞

0

f (x)xs−1dx.

(3.1)

With the additional notation f ♯(x) := x−1f (x−1), the Weil’s explicit formula takes the form (cf.[1])

(3.4)

It should be noted that the sum in the left hand side of (3.2), whose general term is oscillatory, is
only conditionally convergent. This issue of lack of absolute convergence is an essential feature of
Riemann’s formula for the function π(x) which is the number of primes less than x. In our situation
this issue does not appear since we shall only apply the explicit formula to functions which are
the convolution (for the group R∗
+) of two square integrable functions with compact support, thus
ensuring the absolute convergence of the sum over the zeros.
An equivalent formulation, known as Guinand-Weil formula, uses the Fourier transform

(cid:98)F (s) :=

F (u)u−isd∗u,

d∗u =

(3.5)

in place of the Mellin transform (3.1). The passage from one to the other is be obtained by
implementing the automorphism

f (cid:55)→ ∆1/2f = F,

i .e.

F (x) = x1/2f (x),

which respects the convolution product and satisfies the equalities

(∆1/2f ♯)(x) = x1/2f ♯(x) = x−1/2f (x−1) = (∆1/2f )(x−1).

For a rational place v, denoting Wv(F ) := Wv(∆−1/2F ), the above distributions Wp take the
following form:

Wp(F ) = (log p)

The components WR and Wp are as above, and the functional W0,2 is

(3.11)

There is a rather subtle invariance property of the Weil sesquilinear form, namely its symmetry
under the inversion ι(u) = u−1, u ∈ R∗, which will play a significant role in its explicit description.

Lemma 3.1. The Weil functional Ψ fulfills

Proof. This follows from the construction of Ψ. Note the factor 1

2 in (3.15).

Proposition 3.2. Let λ > 1, L = 2 log λ.
(i) The following map is an isometry κ : L2([0, L], dx) → L2([λ−1, λ], d∗u),

m=1

κ(f )(u) = f (log(λu))

(3.17)

which induces an isomorphism C∞([0, L]) → C∞([λ−1, λ]).
(ii) Let f, g ∈ C∞([0, L]). One has

QW (κ(f ), κ(g)) = Ψ♯(F ), F (u) = q(f, g)(log u).

(3.18)

Proof. (i) Follows since the map u (cid:55)→ log(λu) is a diffeomorphism from [λ−1, λ] to [0, L] transforming
the measure d∗u into the measure dx.
(ii) One has, by Lemma 3.1,

QW (κ(f ), κ(g)) = Ψ♯(h + h ◦ ι), h = κ(f )∗ ∗ κ(g).

Let us show that h + h ◦ ι = F . By Lemma 2.2, one has, with a = − L
2

q(f, g) = q(fa, ga), fa(x) := f (x +

L
2

), ga(x) := g(x +

L
2

)

so that fa and ga have support in [− L
log is the isomorphism of locally compact groups log : R∗
involutive convolution algebras

2 ] and one has κ(f ) = fa ◦ log, κ(g) = ga ◦ log, where the
+ → R. This induces an isomorphism of

◦ log : L1(R, dx) → L1(R∗

+, d∗x).

Thus one gets

h = κ(f )∗ ∗ κ(g) = (fa ◦ log)∗ ∗ (ga ◦ log) = (f ∗

a ∗ ga) ◦ log

which using (2.4) gives

h + h ◦ ι = q(fa, ga) ◦ log = q(f, g) ◦ log = F.

and hence the required equality.

here Λ(n) is the von Mangoldt function, and T (n) is the bounded self-adjoint operator in L2([λ−1, λ], d∗u)
defined by

⟨f | T (n)g⟩ = n−1/2 (cid:0)(f ∗ ∗ g)(n) + (f ∗ ∗ g)(n−1)(cid:1) .
(3.20)
Proposition 3.3. ([4, §2]) The quadratic form QWλ is lower bounded and lower semi-continuous.
Recall that a lower bounded, lower semi-continuous (lsc) quadratic form Q on a Hilbert space H is
a lower semi-continuous map Q : H → (−∞, +∞], i.e. such that Q(ξ) ≤ lim inf Q(ξn) when ξn → ξ,
which fulfills Q(λξ) = |λ|2Q(ξ) for all λ ∈ C, satisfies the parallelogram law

Q(ξ + η) + Q(ξ − η) = 2Q(ξ) + 2Q(η)

and also an inequality of the form Q(ξ) ≥ −c∥ξ∥2 for all ξ ∈ H reflecting the lower bound
of q. The associated sesquilinear form (antilinear in the first variable) is given on the domain
Dom(Q) := {ξ ∈ H | Q(ξ) < ∞} by

Q(ξ, η) :=

1
4

(Q(ξ + η) − Q(ξ − η) + iQ(iξ + η) − iQ(iξ − η)) .

Let Vn : [λ−1, λ] → C be the function κ(Un), i.e.

Vn(u) := Un(log(λu)), ∀u ∈ [λ−1, λ]

(3.21)

and let E ⊂ L2([λ−1, λ], d∗u) be the linear subspace generated by the Vn for n ∈ Z.
Proposition 3.4. ([4, Prop. 2.3]) The space E is a core for the quadratic form QWλ : L2([λ−1, λ], d∗u) →
(−∞, +∞], which satisfies, for any f ∈ L2([λ−1, λ], d∗u),

QWλ(f, f ) = lim inf
gn→f

QWλ(gn, gn), gn ∈ E.

(3.22)

In particular, the lower bound of QWλ is the limit, when N → ∞, of the smallest eigenvalue of the
restriction of QWλ to the linear span EN of the functions Vk with |k| ≤ N .

3.2 Discrete spectrum of the semilocal Weil quadratic form QWλ

At this juncture we appeal to a basic result from the general theory of quadratic forms. Adopting
the notation in [12, Ch. 10], to a quadratic form t one associates a mapping t′ : H → R ∪ {+∞} by
setting t′[x] = t[x] if x is in D(t) and t′[x] = +∞ if x is not in D(t). According to [12, Proposition
10.1] the following four conditions are equivalent:

9

3.2 Discrete spectrum of the semilocal Weil quadratic form QWλ

1. t is closed.

2. If (xn)n∈N is a sequence from D(t) such that limn→∞ xn = x in H for some x ∈ H and

limn,k→∞ t [xn − xk] = 0, then x ∈ D(t) and limn→∞ t [xn − x] = 0.

3. t′ is a lower semicontinuous function on H.

4. If (xn)n∈N is a sequence from D(t) such that limn→∞ xn = x in H for some x ∈ H and the set

{t [xn] : n ∈ N} is bounded, then we have x ∈ D(t) and t[x] ≤ lim inf n→∞ t [xn].

By Proposition 3.3 the condition (3) is fulfilled by the semilocal Weil quadratic form QWλ, and
therefore Theorem 10.7 in [12], reproduced below, applies.
Representation theorem for semibounded forms – If t is a densely defined lower semibounded
closed form on H, then the operator At is self-adjoint, and t is equal to the form t(At) associated
with At.

Thus, for each λ > 1, there is a canonical lower bounded unbounded selfadjoint operator Aλ in the
Hilbert space L2 (cid:0)(cid:2)λ−1, λ(cid:3) , d∗u(cid:1) such that

QWλ(f, f ) = ⟨Aλf | f ⟩.

(3.23)

By construction the unbounded selfadjoint operator Aλ is lower bounded. The issue is to show that
it has discrete spectrum. We use the following from [12], Proposition 10.6,

Proposition 3.5. Suppose that A ≥ mA is a lower semibounded self-adjoint operator and m < mA.
Then the following assertions are equivalent:

1. The embedding map ItA : (D[A], ∥ · ∥tA) → (H, ∥ · ∥) is compact.

2. The resolvent Rλ(A) is compact for one, hence for all, λ ∈ ρ(A).

3. (A − mI)−1/2 is compact.

4. A has a purely discrete spectrum.

Theorem 3.6. The selfadjoint operator Aλ has discrete lower bounded spectrum.

Proof. By the proof of the lower boundedness in [4], the contribution of the non-archimedean primes
to the operator Aλ is bounded as well as the contribution of the evaluation of the Fourier transform
at the poles. Thus it is enough to deal, for any λ > 1 with the contribution of the archimedean
place to Aλ in the Hilbert space L2 (cid:0)(cid:2)λ−1, λ(cid:3) , d∗u(cid:1). It is given, after Fourier transform, by the
multiplication by

∂tθ(t) =

(log(|t|) − log(2) − log(π)) −

(3.24)

48t2 + O (cid:0)t−4(cid:1)

2

whose asymptotic expansion allows one to use instead the operator L of multiplication (in Fourier)
by the function which is 1 for |t| ≤ e and log(|t|) otherwise. Note that the factor 1
2π is taken care of
since the unitary Fourier transform has a factor

1√

.

10

3.2 Discrete spectrum of the semilocal Weil quadratic form QWλ

By Proposition 3.5, it is enough to show that the embedding map I : (D[L ], ∥ · ∥tL) → (H, ∥ · ∥) is
compact. The map I is of norm ≤ 1 by construction and it is enough to show that the image of the
unit ball is precompact in the following sense:
Let E be a metric space. If any of the following three properties is satisfied, then all three are
satisfied, and E is said to be precompact:
1. For every ε > 0, E can be covered by a finite number of balls of radius ε;
2. For every ε > 0, E can be covered by a finite number of subsets with diameter less than ε;
3. Every sequence in E has a Cauchy subsequence.
We shall show that for any positive increasing function ρ : [0, ∞) → [1, ∞) such that ρ(u) → ∞
when u → ∞ the embedding Iρ of the Hilbert space Dρ in L2 (cid:0)(cid:2)λ−1, λ(cid:3) , d∗u(cid:1) is compact, where the
norm square in Dρ is given by

(cid:90)

∥f ∥2

ρ :=

| ˆf (t)|2 ρ(t)

dt

(3.25)

In fact one can use the logarithm-exponential isomorphism and replace the Hilbert space L2 (cid:0)(cid:2)λ−1, λ(cid:3) , d∗u(cid:1)
by H = L2 ([−L, L] , dx) and use the ordinary Fourier transform in (3.25). It is enough to show that
the image Iρ(B) of the unit ball B of Dρ is precompact in H. Let then ϵ > 0 and let us show that
one can cover Iρ(B) by finitely many balls of radius ϵ for the norm of H. Since ρ(u) → ∞ when
u → ∞ there exists T < ∞ such that

∥f ∥2

ρ ≤ 1 ⇒

(cid:90)

|t|≥T

| ˆf (t)|2 dt
2π

≤ (ϵ/4)2

(3.26)

Next, the operator (cid:99)PT PL is a compact operator in L2(R) and hence the image (cid:99)PT PL(C) of the unit
ball C of L2(R) is precompact in L2(R). By construction Iρ(B) ⊂ H = L2 ([−L, L] , dx) = PLL2(R),
thus the map

is compact. Thus there exists a finite set of functions {fj}j∈J ⊂ B ⊂ Dρ, such that

(cid:99)PT Iρ : Dρ → L2(R)

∀f ∈ B, ∃j | ∥ (cid:99)PT (f − fj)∥2 ≤ (ϵ/2)2.

Thus one has

∀f ∈ B, ∃j ∈ J such that

(cid:90)

|t|≤T

| ˆf (t) − ˆfj(t)|2 dt
2π

≤ (ϵ/2)2

By (3.26) it follows that for any f ∈ B there exists j such that

(cid:90)

H =

∥f − fj∥2

4. The matrix of QWλ in the basis Vn

Corollary 3.7. Let λ > 1. There exists an element ϕ ∈ L2 (cid:0)(cid:2)λ−1, λ(cid:3) , d∗u(cid:1) such that Aλ(ϕ) = µλ ϕ
where µλ is the largest lower bound of the spectrum of Aλ.

Note that we cannot assert that µλ ≥ 0. One has however

λ > λ′ ⇒ µλ ≤ µλ′

(3.27)

Indeed first note that the test functions which are piecewise smooth form a core for the Weil
quadratic form QWλ since the smooth ones already do by [4] and moreover the Fourier transform
of piecewise smooth functions f with compact support are O(|s|−1) since the derivative f ′ is a
bounded measure, so the piecewise smooth functions are in the domain of QWλ. One then uses the
equivalence (with f piecewise smooth)

ν ≤ µλ ⇐⇒ QWλ(f, f ) ≥ ν∥f ∥2, ∀f | support(f ) ⊂ (cid:2)λ−1, λ(cid:3)

Corollary 3.8. If the limit when λ → ∞ of the decreasing function µλ is equal to 0 then RH holds.

4 The matrix of QWλ in the basis Vn

We now compute the matrix of the sesquilinear form QWλ(f, g) = Ψ(f ∗ ∗ g) in the basis {Vn}n∈Z.
By Proposition 3.2 and the equality Vn = κ(Un) we get

QWλ(Vn, Vm) = Ψ#(F ), where F (x) = q(Un, Um)(log x)

(4.1)

and Ψ♯ was defined in (3.13).
Next, we proceed to describe the contribution to the matrix QWλ(Vn, Vm) of each term in (3.13).

4.1 The matrix W0,2(Vn, Vm)

The following lemma shows that the terms W0,2(Vn, Vm) contribute by a rank two matrix.
Lemma 4.1. Let n, m ∈ Z. Let F (x) = q(Un, Um)(log x), then one has :

W0,2(Vn, Vm) = W #

0,2(F ) =

32L sinh2 (cid:0) L
(cid:1) (cid:0)L2 − 16π2mn(cid:1)

(L2 + 16π2m2) (L2 + 16π2n2)

(4.2)

Proof. This is best verified by direct computation.

4.2 The matrix Wp(Vn, Vm)

The contribution of the non archimedean primes is given by (3.16), i.e.

(cid:88)

Wp(Vn, Vm) =

(cid:88)

Λ(k)k−1/2q(Un, Um)(log k).

(4.4)

The explicit expression for ω(x) = q(Un, Um)(x) for x ∈ [0, L], is given by Lemma 2.3. The next
step is to compute the integrals involved, they are given in terms of known functions in the following
proposition 4.2. We let

ρ(x) :=

exp(x/2)
exp(x) − exp(−x)

We let ψ(z) = Γ′(z)/Γ(z) be the digamma function and ψ(1) be its derivative. We use the standard
notation for hypergeometric functions. We use the notation Φ for the Hurwitz-Lerch function

Φ(z, 2, x) =

x2 +

z
(x + 1)2 +

z2
(x + 2)2 +

z3

(x + 4)2 + . . .

An important feature of the formulas is that the parameter e−2L in the various series involved is of
modulus < 1 thus ensuring the convergence and in fact fast numerical convergence for L of order 10.

5 The infrared spectral triples

In this section we shall construct infrared spectral triples naturally associated to the scaling operator
in L2([λ−1, λ], d∗u) with periodic boundary conditions. The intent is to modify the periodic boundary
conditions in order to insert in the kernel of the modified scaling operator the eigenvector which
realizes the minimum of the Weil quadratic form in the Hilbert space L2([λ−1, λ], d∗u). In order to
obtain this perturbation we work at the truncated level and use instead of the evaluation on the
boundary of the interval [λ−1, λ] an approximation to this evaluation which is given by the Dirichlet
kernel. We then show the existence and uniqueness of the perturbed scaling operator, together with
two fundamental facts. The first is that this operator becomes self-adjoint provided one modifies
the inner product using the Weil quadratic form. The second point is that one can compute the
spectrum of this operator using the Fourier transform of the minimal eigenvector.

5.1 Truncation of QWλ

Let λ > 1, L = 2 log λ, Un as defined in (2.6) and Vn = κ(Un) the orthonormal basis of
L2([λ−1, λ], d∗u) given in (3.21). Let N ∈ N, we consider the quadratic form QW N
λ obtained
by restricting the Weil quadratic form QWλ to the finite dimensional space of test functions spanned
by the functions Vn for |n| ≤ N .
By (3.18), the matrix elements of T = QW N

λ in the basis Vn are given by

τn,m =

(cid:90) L

q(Un, Um)(y)D(y)

i, j ∈ {−N, . . . , N }

(5.1)

16

5.2 Properties of truncated matrices

where D is the real distribution D = log∗(Ψ♯) on the interval [0, L].
Lemma 5.1. The matrix τn,m is a real symmetric matrix of the form

τi,i = ai,

∀i,

τi,j =

bi − bj
i − j

∀j ̸= i;

i, j ∈ {−N, . . . , N }

where the real scalars ai fulfill a−j = aj and b−j = −bj for all j ∈ {−N, . . . , N }.

Proof. This follows from the computation of the functions q(Un, Um)(y) for y ∈ [0, L] in (2.8) and
(2.10), which gives for n ̸= m

5.2 Properties of truncated matrices

In this section we let N be a positive integer, EN be the Hilbert space with orthonormal basis
{Vn, n ∈ {−N, . . . , N }} and T a real symmetric matrix of the form (5.2). We recall the basic
properties of [7] for matrices of this form.

Lemma 5.2. (i) Let γ such that γ(Vj) := V−j ∀j ∈ {−N, . . . , N }. One has γ2 = id and T γ = γT .
(ii) Let D be defined by D(Vn) := n Vn for all n ∈ {−N, . . . , N }. One has Dγ = −γD and

D T − T D = |β⟩⟨η| − |η⟩⟨β|, β =

(cid:88)

bj Vj, η =

(cid:88)

Vj.

(5.3)

Proof. (i) One has q−i,−j = qi,j for all i, j ∈ {−N, . . . , N }.
(ii) The diagonal elements of the diagonal matrix D are antisymmetric which gives Dγ = −γD. Let
us prove (5.3). One has

(DT )i,j = iτi,j, (T D)i,j = jτi,j

so that (D T − T D)i,j = (bi − bj) for all i, j ∈ {−N, . . . , N }. Similarly one has

(|β⟩⟨η|)i,j = |β⟩i⟨η|j = bi,

(|η⟩⟨β|)i,j = |η⟩i⟨β|j = bj

which gives the required equality.

Definition 5.3. A real symmetric matrix T commuting with the Z/2-grading γ is even-simple if
its smallest eigenvalue is simple and the corresponding eigenvector ξ satisfies γξ = ξ.

17

5.2 Properties of truncated matrices

We now assume that T is even simple and positive and let ξ ∈ ker T , ξ ̸= 0. The real symmetric
positive matrix T defines an inner product on R2N +1 and its radical consists of the one dimensional
subspace generated by ξ. Let us first show that we can normalize ξ by the condition

If Dξ = 0 then V0 ∈ ker T fulfills (5.4). So we can assume that Dξ ̸= 0. One has T Dξ ̸= 0 since Dξ
is odd and linearly independent of ξ while ker T is one-dimensional. By (5.3) one has

⟨ξ | η⟩ = 1

(5.4)

0 ̸= (D T − T D)(ξ) = |β⟩⟨η|ξ⟩ − |η⟩⟨β|ξ⟩ = |β⟩⟨η|ξ⟩.

Thus one can normalize ξ so that ⟨η|ξ⟩ = 1.
Lemma 5.4. Assume T ≥ 0 and Ker T = Cξ where γξ = ξ and ⟨ξ | η⟩ = 1.
(i) One has T D ξ = −β.
(ii) The operator D′ := D − |D ξ⟩⟨η| induces a selfadjoint operator D” in the Hilbert space associated
to the inner product defined by T , as quotient by null vectors.
(iii) One has, denoting by ξj the components of ξ,

Det(D” − s) = Det(D − s)

N
(cid:88)

j=−N

(j − s)−1ξj.

(5.5)

Proof. (i) We apply (5.3) and get, using T ξ = 0 and ⟨β|ξ⟩ = 0 since the two eigenspaces of γ are
orthogonal,

−T D ξ = (D T − T D)ξ = |β⟩⟨η|ξ⟩ − |η⟩⟨β|ξ⟩ = β.

(ii) The inner product defined by T is given by

⟨f | g⟩T = ⟨T f | g⟩.

We first show that

One has, with R = −|D ξ⟩⟨η|

⟨D′f | g⟩T = ⟨f | D′g⟩T , ∀f, g

(5.6)

⟨D′f | g⟩T = ⟨T D′f | g⟩ = ⟨T Df | g⟩ + ⟨T Rf | g⟩.

By (i), one has T R = −|T Dξ⟩⟨η| = |β⟩⟨η|. Thus

T D′ = T D + |β⟩⟨η|

Moreover by (5.3), one has T D − DT = −|β⟩⟨η| + |η⟩⟨β|. Thus

T D′ = DT + |η⟩⟨β|,

⟨D′f | g⟩T = ⟨DT f | g⟩ + ⟨R′f | g⟩, R′ = |η⟩⟨β|.

18

5.2 Properties of truncated matrices

Moreover, using that both T and D are selfadjoint,

⟨f | D′g⟩T = ⟨T f | Dg⟩ + ⟨T f | Rg⟩ = ⟨DT f | g⟩ + ⟨f | T Rg⟩

and the required equality follows from

T Rg = (−T Dξ)⟨η|g⟩ = β⟨η|g⟩

⟨f | T Rg⟩ = ⟨f | (|β⟩⟨η|g⟩ = ⟨f | β⟩⟨η|g⟩ = ⟨R′f | g⟩.
The Hilbert space H obtained from EN using the inner product ⟨f | g⟩T is the quotient of EN by
the radical Ker T = Cξ. By construction one has D′ξ = 0 so that D′ induces an operator D” in H
and D” is selfadjoint by (7.3).
(iii) Let vj be an orthonormal basis of H of eigenvectors for D” with eigenvalues λj. Let wj ∈ EN
be lifts of the vj. One has D”(vj) = λjvj and hence D′(wj) = λjwj + sjξ for some scalars sj. Thus
in the basis of EN formed by ξ and the wj, the matrix of D′ is triangular, with 0 and the λj on the
diagonal. Thus one gets

Det(D′ − s) = −s

(cid:89)

(λj − s) = −s Det(D” − s)

(5.7)

We now compute Det(D′ − s). We start by writing, in terms of R = −⟨Dξ⟩⟨η|:

D′ − s = D + R − s = (D − s) (cid:0)id + (D − s)−1R(cid:1)

Consequently

Det(D′ − s) = Det(D − s)Det(id + (D − s)−1R).

To compute the second determinant we use the identity

Det(id + A) =

(cid:16)

∧kA

(cid:17)

Tr

∞
(cid:88)

k=0

applied to the rank one operator A = (D − s)−1R. The higher exterior powers ∧kA vanish for k > 1
thus

Det(id + (D − s)−1R) = 1 − Tr (cid:0)|(D − s)−1Dξ⟩⟨η|(cid:1) = −s⟨η|(D − s)−1ξ⟩,

using (D − s)−1Dξ = ξ + s(D − s)−1ξ and ⟨η|ξ⟩ = 1. Hence,

Det(D′ − s) = −s Det(D − s)⟨η|(D − s)−1ξ⟩ = −s Det(D − s)

N
(cid:88)

j=−N

(j − s)−1ξj.

Thus one obtains (5.5) using (5.7).

5.4 The perturbed scaling operator

The perturbed scaling operator D(λ,N )

log

is obtained from the following :

Proposition 5.7. Let λ > 1 and N such that the truncated Weil quadratic form is even simple.
Let ξ be the corresponding even eigenvector. There exists a unique operator D(λ,N )
with the same
domain as D(λ)

log which agrees with this operator on the kernel of δN and such that D(λ,N )
Proof. The Hilbert space L2([λ−1, λ], d∗u) is the direct sum of the finite dimensional subspace
EN spanned by the Vn for |n| ≤ N and its orthogonal complement E⊥
N . Since the Vn form an
orthonormal basis of eigenvectors for D(λ)
log , this operator splits as the direct sum of its restrictions to
EN and E⊥
N and ξ ∈ EN by construction. Thus the existence
and uniqueness of D(λ,N )
is reduced to the finite dimensional subspace EN . One has δN (ξ) ̸= 0 so

KerδN and Cξ span EN and the equality

5.5 Regularized Determinant

5.5 Regularized Determinant

The regularized determinant is defined by

detreg(D − s) = exp (cid:0)−ζ ′

D(0; s)(cid:1)

(5.16)

where ζD(z; s) := (cid:80)(λ − s)−z is the spectral zeta function. There is an ambiguity in the definition
of the zeta function (see [13], §7.1) since raising λ − s to the power −z implies the choice of a
determination of log(λ − s). There is a clear such choice for eigenvalues λ → +∞ but in the negative
direction one needs to make a choice for (−1)−z and this choice of the spectral cut affects the result
in the following basic example. Note that, in this example and taking for simplicity L = 2π, one
could guess the regularized determinant from the Euler product as given by the sine function sin(πs)
but this would violate the spectral invariance s → s + 1. The phase factor in front of the sine
function repairs this violation.

Lemma 5.8. Let L > 0. The regularized determinant for the Dirac operator D with spectrum 2π
L
is given, using (−1)−z := e−iπz, by

Z

Proof. We first take L = 2π to simplify notations. The spectral zeta function is given by

detreg(D − s) = 1 − e−iLs

ζD(z; s) =

(cid:88)

(n − s)−z

n∈Z

This converges for Re(z) > 1. One has

ζD(z; s) =

(cid:88)

(n − s)−z +

For the second sum, substitute n → −m with m ≥ 0 and use (−1)−z := e−iπz

D(0; s)

5.6 Spectrum and regularized determinant of D(λ,N )

log

In this section we prove the fundamental properties of D(λ,N )
and show that its spectrum is real
and that its regularized determinant is (up to a phase factor) the Fourier transform of the minimal
eigenvector ξ.
We first compute the Fourier transform of functions on [λ−1, λ] extended by 0 to R∗

The zeros z ∈ 2πZ/L of sin (sL/2) cancell the poles at 2πj/L which occur when ξj ̸= 0 and remain

7 Outlook

These numerical results provide evidence that the spectra of the operators D(λ,N )
nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function ζ( 1
would amount to a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis.
One can be even more ambitious using Theorem 5.10 together with the observation of [4] that
the eigenfunction associated with the lowest eigenvalue of QWλ is well approximated by prolate
spheroidal wave functions. As we explain now this suggests that the regularized determinants
detreg(D(λ,N )

tend1 to the
2 + is). Establishing this convergence rigorously

log − s) behave as follows

log

• For fixed λ, the functions detreg(D(λ,N )

log − s) converge2 when N → ∞ to the function
−i λ−iz (cid:98)ξλ(z) where ξλ is the eigenfunction of QWλ for the smallest eigenvalue, normalized by
ξ(λ) = 1.

• When λ → ∞ the functions (cid:98)ξλ(z) multiplied by suitable constants, converge uniformly on

closed substrips of the open strip ℑ(z) < 1

2 towards the Ξ-function of Riemann

Ξ(s) = ξ(1/2 + is), ξ(z) =

z(z − 1)π−z/2Γ(z/2)ζ(z)

1
2

In other words the regularized determinants detreg(D(λ,N )
log − s) suitably multiplied by a factor of
the form ea+ibs converge towards Ξ(s). This convergence would entail RH using Hurwitz theorem
on the zeros of limits of holomorphic functions.
We now give more details to give substance to this strategy. First when reading Riemann’s paper

The function h(u) can be characterized as follows. One considers the Hermite operator (harmonic
oscillator)

Hf (u) := −f ′′(u) + 4π2u2f (u)

(7.3)

and lets hn be the normalized eigenfunction for the eigenvalue 2π(1 + 2n). These functions are even
for n even and, for n multiple of 4, invariant under the Fourier transform for the duality ⟨R | R⟩
which is defined by

Lemma 7.1. The Ξ function of Riemann is the Fourier transform of k = E(h) where h is, up to a

We recall the construction of [4] of an educated guess kλ for an approximation of a scalar multiple
of ξλ. It is based on the deformation of the harmonic oscillator called the prolate wave operator
(cid:0)(λ2 − x2)∂x

(cid:1) + (2πλx)2.

P Wλ := −∂x

(7.5)

The eigenfunctions hn,λ(u) of P Wλ have the same labelling as the Hermite functions hn, they are
even for n even and invariant under the Fourier transform for n multiple of 4. In agreement with
Lemma 7.1, the educated guess kλ is

kλ(u) := E(hλ)(u), ∀u ∈ [λ−1, λ]

(7.6)

where hλ is, up to a multiplicative scalar, the only linear combination of h0,λ, h4,λ with vanishing
integral. We refer to [4], Section 3, for the motivation behind the formula for kλ and the numerical
evidence showing that it gives an approximation of a scalar multiple of ξλ. Justifying rigorously
this step is the main remaining obstacle to our approach to RH.
We now use the educated guess (7.6) and evaluate its convergence in the next lemma 7.3. We shall
first describe an estimate from [9].

(ii) By (i), we control the values hn,λ(0) for n = 0, 4. The fundamental property of the prolate
wave functions is that they are eigenfunctions of the compression of the Fourier transform by the
orthogonal projection Pλ of L2(R)even on the subspace of functions with support in the interval
[−λ, λ]. Moreover for small values of n such as n = 0, 4 the eigenvalues χ(λ) are such that 1 − χ(λ)
decays extremely fast when λ → ∞. For instance for n = 4, by [8], Theorem 1, one has

Moreover we have

hn,λ(x)dx − hn(0)| = O(λ−2)

It follows that we obtain a linear combination hλ of h0,λ and h4,λ which has vanishing integral and
fulfills (7.8).

but this tends to 0 when λ → ∞ due to the convergence of the integral.

8 The missing steps

There are two essential steps still missing to justify our tentative proof of the Riemann Hypothesis.
The first is that, in order to apply Theorem 5.10 to the Weil quadratic form QWλ, one must prove
that its smallest eigenvalue—whose existence is ensured by Theorem 3.6—is simple and that its
corresponding eigenvector ξλ is even. The second step is to establish that kλ provides a sufficiently
accurate approximation to (a scalar multiple of) ξλ, in order to justify the convergence of the zeros
of (cid:98)ξλ towards the non-trivial zeros of ζ( 1
There are, however, three indications supporting the feasibility of these steps.
(1) The “simple-even” condition holds for all values of λ for the prolate-wave operator P Wλ.

2 + is).

33

8. The missing steps

(2) The extremely small numbers ελ that occur as eigenvalues of the Weil quadratic form QWλ also
appear—see Figure 4—when evaluating the discrepancy for hλ to belong simultaneously to Pλ and
(cid:98)Pλ.
(3) The numerical evidence for the proximity between kλ and ξλ extends to the higher eigenfunctions
of the Weil quadratic form.

Figure 4: Graphs of log(ϵλ)) and log(1 − χ(λ))) as functions of µ = λ2.

It remains possible that our strategy for proving convergence towards the zeros of ζ( 1
2 + is) will
face significant obstacles. Nevertheless, it provides a strong motivation to further develop the
relationship, first uncovered in [3], between the Weil quadratic form QWλ and the prolate-wave
operator P Wλ. The cornerstone of this development is the trace formula established in [3], which
relates Pλ, (cid:98)Pλ, and the map E to QWλ. Yet, regardless of how far one can progress along this path,
the present approach naturally opens the way to a deeper exploration of the unexpected relationship
between two seemingly distant mathematical worlds.

The world of the Weil quadratic form. A key discovery of Andr´e Weil is the following
remarkable fact: the Riemann Hypothesis is equivalent to the positivity of certain quadratic forms
that involve only finitely many primes. This is striking, since one might expect that addressing the
Riemann Hypothesis would require control over the entire infinite set of primes. Here, however,
the problem acquires a local character, reducing to finite collections at a time. Moreover, in this
framework, as we have seen, one can exploit our general construction of functions whose zeros lie
entirely on the critical line.

The world of prolate wave functions. Developed by David Slepian and collaborators, and
rooted in Claude Shannon’s work on communication theory, this theory exhibits the miraculous
relationship between the orthogonal projections that define time and frequency limitations in signal
analysis and a classical second-order differential operator on the real line: the prolate wave operator,
itself obtained as a confluence from the Heun equation—an object entirely familiar within Riemann’s
mathematical universe.

The prolate operator plays a dual role. In the infrared regime, it provides a tool for approximating

the minimal eigenvector of the Weil quadratic form. At the opposite, ultraviolet, end it also
furnishes—cf. [6]—a model of a self-adjoint operator whose spectrum reflects the high-frequency
(ultraviolet) behavior of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. This duality emphasizes how ideas
from information theory, spectral analysis, and number theory converge within a unified framework,
turning the relation between QWλ and P Wλ into a fertile ground for further exploration.
