AN EXPLICIT LOG-FREE ZERO DENSITY ESTIMATE FOR
THE RIEMANN ZETA-FUNCTION

CHIARA BELLOTTI

Abstract. We will provide an explicit log-free zero-density estimate for ζ(s)
of the form N (σ, T ) ≤ AT B(1−σ). In particular, this estimate becomes the
sharpest known explicit zero-density estimate uniformly for σ ∈ [α0, 1], with
0.985 ≤ α0 ≤ 0.9927 and 3 · 1012 < T ≤ exp(6.7 · 1012).

1. Introduction

Consider the Riemann zeta function ζ(s) and let ρ = β + iγ be a zero of ζ(s)
with 0 < Re(ρ) < 1. Studying the zeros of ζ(s) is a classical problem in number
theory and several approaches have been followed throughout the years to have a
better understanding of the behaviour of the zeros of ζ(s) inside the critical strip.
Among them, one is ﬁnding upper bounds for the number of zeros of ζ(s) inside a
ﬁxed region. These estimates are commonly known as zero-density estimates. More
precisely, for ﬁxed 1/2 < σ < 1 and T > 0, we deﬁne the quantity

N (σ, T ) = #
{

ρ = β + iγ : ζ(ρ) = 0, 0 < γ < T, σ < β < 1

,

}

which counts the number of non-trivial zeros of ζ(s) with real part greater than
the ﬁxed value σ. The goal is to ﬁnd upper bounds for N (σ, T ) that are as sharp
as possible. Trivially, if the Riemann Hypothesis is true then all the non-trivial
zeros of ζ(s) would lie on the half-line σ = 1/2 and hence N (σ, T ) = 0 for every
1/2 < σ < 1.

≪

Zero-density estimates for ζ(s) often take the form N (σ, T )

T B(1−σ)(log T )D,
where B, D are constants which might depend on σ. There is an extensive literature
on such results, some of which will be recalled in the following paragraph. Usually,
a large amount of work is done in trying to minimize the exponent B for a wide
range of σ, while allowing D to be a large absolute constant. In particular, it has

been conjectured that the estimate N (σ, T )
1/2 < σ < 1 and T > 0 (this conjecture, also known as the Density Hypothesis,
is actually weaker than what one would get if the Riemann Hypothesis is true).
However, our goal is to focus on estimates where D = 0, that is, estimates of the
form

This type of estimate is commonly known as a log-free zero-density estimate. There
is a vast number of research works on the log-free zero-density estimates, starting
with Linnik [Lin44a; Lin44b] and following with many other authors, including
Tur´an [Tur61], Fogels [Fog65], Bombieri [Bom74], Jutila [Jut77], Gallagher [Gal70],

For completeness, we mention some of the known results for N (σ, T ). In 2021, Platt

Hence, we can restrict the range of values of T for which we want to ﬁnd an upper
bound for N (σ, T ) to T > 3

1012 and, as a consequence, N (σ, T ) = 0 for every 1/2 < σ < 1, T

Furthermore, in 2000, Bourgain [Bou00] proved that the Density Hypothesis is

σ < 1 it is possible to get upper
bounds for the quantity N (σ, T ) which are sharper than the Density Hypothesis
(see [TY24] and [Pin23] for more recent results). However, although the Density

While non-explicit estimates for N (σ, T ) are widely studied, much less is known
about explicit estimates for N (σ, T ). Ingham’s estimate has been made explicit by
Ramar´e [Ram16] and then improved by Kadiri, Lumley and Ng [KLN18]. When σ
is really close to the 1/2 line, an explicit version of Selberg’s estimate [Sel46] is pro-
vided by the work of Simoniˇc in [Sim20]. When instead σ is really close to 1 and T
quite large, the author provided an explicit version of the upper bound of the form
(log T )D [Bel23]. Explicit log-free zero density estimates for
N (σ, T )
Dirichlet L-Functions have been found by Thorner and Zaman in [TZ24]. The es-
timate found in [TZ24] holds also for ζ(s), but in this case the exponent is too big
to be used in some applications which might beneﬁt from the existence of a log-
free zero density estimate for ζ(s) and which we will list in the following paragraph.

The aim of this paper is to provide a new explicit log-free zero density estimate
for ζ(s) of the form (1.1). Furthermore, this estimate becomes the sharpest known

with B = 1.448 and C = 1.62
explained before, Theorem 1.1 provides much sharper estimates depending on the
size of T . An analysis of the values of both C and B listed in Table 2 shows that
when T increases, C increases, but on the contrary B decreases quite consistently.
This balance between increasing values of C and decreasing values of B when T
becomes larger allow us to get sharp upper bounds for N (σ, T ) in a certain region
on the left of the zero-free region for ζ(s). The python program used to compute
C and B is available on github at [Bel]. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the
computational aspects of this work can be found in Appendix A.

Remark. The method can be adapted to get log-free zero-density estimates for
ζ(s) for values of σ which are smaller than 0.985, and which can be sharper than
the current known estimates of the type (1.6), provided that T is in suﬃciently
large (T > exp(90)). However, we limit ourselves to provide a log-free zero-density
0.985, as values of σ which are really close to 1 are usually needed
estimate for σ
in the majority of the applications.

Remark. The above choice of splitting the proof of Theorem 1.1 in two cases and
using the partial veriﬁcation of the Riemann Hypothesis when γ

every T . However, this is not a big limitation, since when T is suﬃciently large,
estimates of the form N (σ, T )

which increases with T and hence it is not absolutely bounded.

Theorem 1.1, combined with the results in [Bel23] can lead to improvements in
several other topics in computational number theory, such as the error term in the
Prime Number Theorem (see [JY23; FKS23]), primes between consecutive powers
(see [CH23; JCH24]), Ramanujan’s inequality (see [PT20; CHJ23]).

1.2. Comparison with existent estimates. In this subsection, we try to com-
pare Theorem 1.1 with the existing explicit zero-density estimates. Since we are
1012), we just need to compare Theorem 1.1 with
working with T

where C1, C2 are absolute constants which depend on σ. The values of C1, C2 have
been slightly improved by Johnston and Yang in [JY23] and we will refer to these
new values throughout the comparison with the estimate found in Theorem 1.1.
To verify that the estimate found in Theorem 1.1 is always sharper than (1.6) in
(T0, T1] listed in Table 2 in Appendix A, we

Another remark is that, when T is suﬃciently large, that is, T
exponent B is less than 2 which is the exponent conjectured in the Density Hypoth-
esis. This makes sense, since it has already been proved non-explicitly that when
σ is suﬃciently close to 1, we can get upper bounds for N (σ, T ) which are sharper
than the one conjectured in the Density Hypothesis, as we already mentioned be-
fore.
To give an idea of the size of the improvements of Theorem 1.1 on (1.6), we just
list a few cases, keeping σ ﬁxed and letting T vary or vice versa.

3. Construction of the zero-detector

Throughout the proof, we will often refer to some techniques used by Pintz in
a recent work [Pin19] on some new non-explicit zero-density estimates for some
L-functions.
We start deﬁning the following Barban-Vehov weights (ψd)d and (θd)d by

We observe that θd is a special case of ψd with U = 1 and V = W . Also, Ψ(n) = 0
for 2
We aim to ﬁnd some explicit bounds for sums involving both Ψ and Θ. In order to
do that, we introduce two other quantities due to Graham [Gra78]. Assume that

z1 ≤

Λi(d) = µ(d) log (zi/d)

We observe that, if z1 < z2, and z1 = U , z2 = V , we have exactly

ψd =

.

(3.2)

Furthermore, if we put z1 = W , we have

θd =

L := log T, U = T u,

V = T v, W = T w, X = T x,

(3.8)

where 0 < u < v and w, x > 0, with w < u, u + v < x, are suitably chosen positive
constants whose values can be found in Table 4 in Appendix A and depend on both

σ. We split the range of values for T into several
sub-intervals (T0, T1], in order to have sharper estimates in each of these smaller
ranges. The criteria with which the sizes of the diﬀerent intervals are chosen will
be explained in Appendix A.
From now on, we will present the argument in terms of x, u, v, w. Then, depending
on the range of T , we just need to substitute the values in the table inside the
argument to get the ﬁnal numerical estimate of Theorem 1.1 for each of the intervals.

the zero-free regions mentioned before in Section 2, where i = 1, 2, 3, 4, depending on
the range of T in which we are working. Then, for each of these smaller rectangles,
we choose a representative zero arbitrarily.
Denote with J the total number of these representative zeros. Our main goal is to
ﬁnd an upper bound for the quantity

multiplying (4.22) by the quantity ˜n(α) in Lemma 2.4 we have

Appendix A. Computation and Numerical Values

In this Appendix, we list the numerical values for all the parameters and con-
stants we encountered throughout the proof of Theorem 1.1 for every ﬁxed interval
(T0, T1], and [α0, 1]. To compute all the constants deﬁned throughout the proof
of Theorem 1.1, one can use the python program available on github at [Bel] with
t = T0, tupp = T1, sigma = α0, and u, x, v, w equal to the corresponding values
listed in Table 4 (t, tupp, sigma, u, x, v, w are the variables deﬁned in the python
program). Furthermore, the values of u, x, v, w were chosen using a stochastic op-
timization routine.

We brieﬂy explain our choice for the length of the intervals (T0, T1]. First of
all, none of the intervals (T0, T1] intersects the range of values of T for which two
diﬀerent zero-free regions become the sharpest ones (the range of values of T for
which each of the known zero-free regions becomes the widest are mentioned in
Section 2).

AN EXPLICIT LOG-FREE ZERO DENSITY ESTIMATE

27

The most sensitive area in which it is more diﬃcult to get an improvement on
exp(46.2) which is just above the Riemann height,
(1.6) is the range 3
and which correspond to the range of T for which the classical zero-free region (2.1)
is the largest. Hence, when 3
exp(46.2), we choose (T0, T1] so that, if
T0 = exp(n), then T1 = exp(n + 1).

When exp(46.2) < T

exp(170.2), that is, when Ford’s zero-free region (2.2)
becomes sharper, a slightly enlargement of the intervals (T0, T1] still allows us to
get improvements on (1.6), but with the beneﬁt of dealing with less cases. More
precisely, we choose (T0, T1] so that, if T0 = exp(n), then T1 = exp(n + 10).

≤

Then, for exp(170.2) < T

exp(481958), which is the range of T for which the
Littlewood zero-free region (2.3) is the sharpest, we further enlarge the size of the
intervals for the same reason as before. More precisely, when exp(170.2) < T
exp(3000), if T0 = exp(n), then T1 = exp(n + 500). When instead exp(3000) < T
exp(481958), we just consider a single interval.

When T > exp(481958), as we mentioned in Section 2, the Korobov–Vinogradov
zero-free region (2.4) becomes the widest one. Although the range (exp(481958),
1012)] is unlikely to be required in many applications, for completeness we
exp(6.7
provide anyway a log-free zero-density estimate which holds uniformly for every σ

[0.985, 1]. More precisely, if we take u = 0.3520926, x = 0.7238738, v = 0.3616651,
T 1.448(1−σ) for all σ
1011
w = 0.0000662, we get N (σ, T )
