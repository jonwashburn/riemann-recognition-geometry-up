ASPECTS OF THE SCREW FUNCTION CORRESPONDING TO
THE RIEMANN ZETA-FUNCTION

MASATOSHI SUZUKI

Abstract. We introduce a screw function corresponding to the Riemann zeta-function
and study its properties from various aspects. Typical results are several equivalent
conditions for the Riemann hypothesis in terms of the screw function. One of them
can be considered an analog of so-called Weil’s positivity or Li’s criterion. In addition,
we prove a few partial but unconditional results for such equivalents.

Let ζ(s) be the Riemann zeta-function and let ξ(s) be the Riemann xi-function. The

latter is an entire function deﬁned by

Typical results of the present paper are several equivalent conditions for the Riemann
hypothesis (RH, for short) which claims that all zeros of ξ(s) lie on the critical line

By the ﬁrst equality in (1.3), the function Ψ(t) is naturally extended to an even
function on the real line. Therefore, we henceforth identify Ψ(t) with that extended
even function, that is, we understand by replacing t with
t in the right-hand side
of (1.1) when t is negative. Also, by Theorem 1.1, any of (1.1), (1.3), or the Fourier
inversion of (1.2) can be chosen as the deﬁnition of Ψ(t), but in this paper, we chose
deﬁnition (1.1) including prime numbers.

from the Fourier integral formula (1.2) and the uniqueness of the Fourier transform.
Conversely, assuming that this g(t) is a screw function, the RH holds from (1.2) and the
above result of Kre˘ın–Langer.

Hence we obtain the following equivalent condition for the RH which is the starting

point of other equivalent conditions for the RH in the present paper.

Theorem 1.2. The RH is true if and only if g(t) deﬁned by (1.8) is a screw function

Henceforth throughout this paper, g(t) is the function deﬁned by (1.1) and (1.8), and
Gg(t, u) is the kernel deﬁned by (1.4) for this g(t), unless stated otherwise. We call g(t)
the screw function of the Riemann zeta-function after Theorem 1.2, although it is an
abuse of words in a strict sense. The series representation of g(t) obtained from (1.3) is
nothing but an integral representation of a screw function ([16, Theorem 5.1 and (7.11)])

(cf. the second line of the proof of [16, Theorem 5.1]). The kernel Gg(t, u) is non-negative
on R2 under the RH, but it can be shown unconditionally that Gg(t, u) is non-negative
if

As a main application of Theorem 1.2, we obtain a variant of Weil’s famous criterion

This makes the strategy of Yoshida [33] and E. Bombieri [1] for the RH via the Weil
distribution analytically more straightforward and simple.

It is well known that the continuity of the kernel is not suﬃcient to conclude that
the corresponding integral operator is of trace class. If we assume that the RH is true,
Gg[a] is a positive deﬁnite Hilbert–Schmidt operator for every 0 < a <
. Therefore,
it is a trace class operator by Mercer’s theorem. Furthermore, the traceability of Gg[a]
does not depend on the deﬁniteness of Gg[a] as follows.

Li, the Li coeﬃcients are also referred to as the Keiper–Li coeﬃcients in some literature.
Bombieri–Lagarias [2] found that the positivity of all Li coeﬃcients is a discretization
of the positivity of the Weil distribution. The relation of Theorems 1.3 and 1.8 can be
considered as an analog of the relation of the Weil distribution and Li coeﬃcients (see
also Section 3.4). We are then interested in a direct relation between moments µn and Li
coeﬃcients λn. Changing of variables as z = (i/2)(1

The similarity between (1.14) and (1.15) is obvious, and it is shown in Section 8 that
there is an explicit relation between them.

Recall (1.7) and deﬁne qξ(z) := Qξ(√z)/√z. Then, qξ(z) belongs to the subclass of
corresponding to Kre˘ın’s strings under the RH (see Section 9). The corresponding

N
string is the one named Zeta string by S. Kotani [12].

On the other hand, the series representation (1.3) suggests that g(t) =

Ψ(t) is a
mean-periodic function by appropriate choice of function space. In fact, it is uncondi-
tionally shown that g(t) is mean-periodic using the function spaces used in Fesenko–
Ricotta–Suzuki [8] (see Section 10).

The functions in class

Ga have various fruitful connections with many diﬀerent mathe-
matical objects, for example, due to a relation with positive-deﬁnite functions described
in [16]. Therefore, more interesting discoveries and connections are expected for the
screw function of the Riemann zeta-function from the origin mentioned above. Further-
more, although this paper focused only on the Riemann zeta-function for simplicity, it
would be natural to extend the results of this paper to other general L-functions like
automorphic L-functions or L-functions in the Selberg class. However, we leave such
studies for other papers [22, 25, 26, 27, 28] and future research.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we prove Theorem 1.1 and a lemma
needed in later sections. In Section 3, we prove Theorem 1.3 after reviewing the Weil
distribution and preparing for the notation. In Section 4, we establish the pointwise non-
negativity of Ψ(t), and the non-negativity of Gg(t, u) for small t, u, as a preliminary step
towards proving Theorem 1.4. Moreover, we state and prove a lower bound for
iGg ,a
under restrictions to φ. In Section 5, we prove Theorem 1.4 using results in Section 4
and make a comparison with Yoshida’s results. In Section 6, we prove Theorem 1.5 and
study eigenvalues of the kernel Gg(t, u). In Section 7, we prove Theorems 1.6 and 1.7,
and 1.8. In Section 8, we describe explicit relations between the moments µn and the
Li coeﬃcients. In Section 9, we describe a Kre˘ın string corresponding to Qξ(z) in (1.7)
under the RH. In Section 10, we discuss the mean-periodicity of the screw function g(t).
In Section 11, we introduce variants Ψω(t) of Ψ(t) and state an analog of Theorem 1.7.
Further, we study relations among diﬀerent Ψω(t)’s.

2.3. Proof of Theorems 1.1 (3). The assertion aimed at follows from the following
proposition and (1.1). The result is weaker than the one that follows from the best

2.4. Lemma. The following lemma is often used in subsequent sections.

Lemma 2.1. Let F (z) be an entire function of the exponential type and let A be a
complex number. Suppose that F (γ) = A for all zeros γ of ξ(1/2
iz). Then F (z) = A
as a function.

−

Proof. It suﬃces to deal only with case of A = 0. The number of zeros of F (z) in the
r counted with multiplicity is O(r) by the assumption. On the other hand,
disc
r is not O(r) by [29, Section
the number of distinct zeros of ξ(1/2

The known result that the number of simple zeros of ζ(s) on the critical line up to
height T is bounded below by T log T is more convenient for the proof of Lemma 2.1
(see Conrey [6] and his comments on the result of Levinson (1974) in the introduction).

We denote the Fourier transform of φ(t) as

First, we show the second half of Theorem 1.4. Since g(t) is continuous and hermitian
on the real line, the integral operator Gg[a] on L2(
a, a) deﬁned in (1.12) is a self-adjoint
. Therefore, the spectrum of Gg[a] consists

of eigenvalues and zero. Whether or not zero is an eigenvalue is not determined by the
·iGg ,a is non-negative deﬁnite if and only if all
general theory. The hermitian form
eigenvalues of Gg[a] are non-negative, and the nondegeneracy for

to that Gg[a] does not have zero as an eigenvalue, since

From Theorem 1.6 we are interested in the supreme of values of Ψ(t). It is clearly

obtained from (1.1) and (1.3) is an analog of the summation formula [8, Corollary 4.6].
