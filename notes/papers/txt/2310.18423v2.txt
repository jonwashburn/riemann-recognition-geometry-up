ZETA ZEROS AND PROLATE WAVE OPERATORS

SEMILOCAL ADELIC OPERATORS

Alain Connes, Caterina Consani and Henri Moscovici

Abstract. — We integrate in the framework of the semilocal trace formula two recent discoveries on
the spectral realization of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function by introducing a semilocal analogue
of the prolate wave operator. The latter plays a key role both in the spectral realization of the low lying
zeros of zeta–using the positive part of its spectrum–and of their ultraviolet behavior–using the Sonin
space which corresponds to the negative part of the spectrum. In the archimedean case the prolate
operator is the sum of the square of the scaling operator with the grading of orthogonal polynomials,
and we show that this formulation extends to the semilocal case. We prove the stability of the semilocal
Sonin space under the increase of the ﬁnite set of places which govern the semilocal framework and
describe their relation with Hilbert spaces of entire functions. Finally, we relate the prolate operator
to the metaplectic representation of the double cover of SL(2, R) with the goal of obtaining (in a
forthcoming paper) a second candidate for the semilocal prolate operator.

The diﬃculty of solving the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) is often primarily attributed to the inﬁnite
number of terms within the Euler product.

However, contrary to this widespread belief, there exists a property P (n), involving only the Euler
factors for primes smaller than n, and whose validity for all n is equivalent to RH. This is derived
from Weil’s positivity criterion which involves the quadratic form Qn deﬁned using the Riemann-
Weil explicit formulas applied to test functions with support in the compact symmetric interval [ 1
n , n].
Furthermore, the semilocal trace formula of [7] gives, for each n, a Hilbert space theoretic framework
in which the Weil quadratic form Qn becomes the trace of a simple operator theoretic expression,
thus oﬀering a natural ground of exploration in order to attack RH. The present paper furthers
the development of the operator-theoretic approach to RH by providing a uniﬁed framework that
incorporates two recent discoveries related to the spectral realization of the zeros of the Riemann
zeta function.
On the one hand, the results of [9,10] show that the semilocal trace formula of [7] gives a conceptual
explanation of Weil’s positivity for the archimedean place, the source of it being the Hilbert space
representation of the scaling group. Moreover, in the same vein [11] shows that one can access to
the infrared (low lying) part of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function using the scaling operator
with periodic boundary conditions, restricted to the orthogonal of the radical of the Weil quadratic
form. On the other hand the unusual ultraviolet behavior of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function
found an unexpected spectral incarnation in [12] in terms of the negative eigenvalues of the classical
prolate wave operator extended to the whole real line.
In this paper we blend together these developments and go beyond the single archimedean place,
using the semilocal framework of [7] which provides a canonical Hilbert space-operator theoretic
stage in which the main players continue to make sense, and both the explicit formula and the
radical of the Weil quadratic form have a conceptual meaning.
The role of the prolate operator is crucial in both (infrared and ultraviolet) observed agreements with
zeros of zeta. Its signiﬁcance in [11] arises because the radical of the Weil quadratic form is given by
the range of the map E deﬁned on the Schwartz space S(R)ev
f (nu).
When applied to eigenfunctions ϕn of the prolate operator for positive eigenvalues, one generates
extremely small eigenvalues of the Weil quadratic form restricted to functions with ﬁxed compact
support. The corresponding eigenfunctions ψn of the Weil quadratic form are reconstructed in [11]
by Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization of E(ϕn). The semilocal form of the map E agrees with the
canonical identiﬁcation of the semilocal functions with functions on idele classes. The conceptual
meaning of the map E will become clear in the semilocal formalism. The eigenfunctions ψn were
used in [11] to condition the scaling operator with periodic boundary conditions. With this process
we generated the low-lying zeros of the zeta function, while the ultraviolet behavior of the zeros
remained out of reach. Thus the fact that the expected UV behavior is realized by the negative
spectrum of the prolate operator suggests the tantalizing program of ﬁnding the semilocal analogue
of the prolate operator. We expect that the use of such operator-theoretic tools in the semilocal case
opens a way to handle Weil’s positivity as in [10]. In fact, the operator theoretic aspect of the present
paper provides a more precise strategy for addressing the semilocal Weil positivity by comparing

0 by the formula E(f )(u) := u1/2

the trace functional associated to the operator- which is automatically positive for a selfadjoint
operator- with the Weil functional. The conditioning, by the radical of the Weil quadratic form,
that worked for the scaling operator in the infrared case will be implemented automatically by the
orthogonality of the positive and the negative part of the spectrum of the semilocal prolate operator,
whose corresponding negative eigenspace (1) was identiﬁed in [12] to the Sonin space.
Our approach involves reinterpreting the prolate operator to propose a candidate for its semilocal
counterpart. This is done by placing at the forefront the scaling operator, whose semilocal version
is well established in [7], as well as the Sonin space.
The scaling operator S is the selfadjoint generator of the group of dilations in the Hilbert space
L2(R)ev of square integrable even functions on the real line. The prolate operator admits a simple
expression in terms of the operator S and the vector given by the function ξ(x) := e−
. This
vector belongs to the domain of Sn for any n, and the span of the Snξ is L2(R)ev. We let N be
the grading associated to the ﬁltration coming from the linear span of polynomials p(S)ξ, with
deg P
n. Ignoring the delicate domain deﬁnition needed to obtain a selfadjoint operator, the
prolate operator Wλ is given by the formal expression

Formula (2) is meaningful for any cyclic pair (D, ξ) given by a selfadjoint operator D acting in
a Hilbert space H and a unit vector ξ
NDomDn which is cyclic (i.e. such that the vectors
∈
p(D)ξ with p a polynomial, are dense in H). For any cyclic pair (D, ξ), the spectral theorem
provides a canonical form (or diagonalization) in which D is represented as the multiplication by
R in the Hilbert space H = L2(R, dµ) where dµ is the spectral measure deﬁned
the variable s
, and the cyclic vector ξ is the constant function 1. The theory of
by
i
orthogonal polynomials for the measure dµ then provides the representation of D as a Jacobi
matrix and of the grading operator N as a diagonal matrix. We recall these basic facts in section 2.
It turns out that one can naturally associate to a cyclic pair a spectral triple (A, H, D) where H
and D are unchanged while the algebra A := c0(N) acts via the grading operator N associated to
the orthogonal polynomials of the spectral measure. The role of the spectral triple (A, H, D) is to
D2 by the addition
understand algebraically the prolate operator as a perturbation of the operator
of an element of the algebra A. The spectral triple (A, H, D) of a cyclic pair is even (in the sense
that it admits a Z/2Z-grading commuting with the algebra and anticommuting with D) if and only
s. Moreover such a Z/2Z-grading γ
if the spectral measure dµ is even, i.e. invariant under s
is unique if it exists. In the even case one obtains a Jacobi matrix representation for the prolate
operator (proposition 2.4).
In section 3 we describe in Theorem 3.1 the canonical form of the even cyclic pair associated to
the scaling operator D = S and the cyclic vector ξ
. The grading is given by the
Fourier transform FeR acting in L2(R)ev. The isomorphism with the canonical form is given by the

in section 3.4 the hermitian Jacobi matrix of the scaling operator S in the basis of orthogonal
polynomials. Its diagonal elements are 0, while the non-zero matrix elements above the diagonal

associated to the operators S2 restricted to the eigenspaces of FeR for the eigenvalues

Section 4 is devoted to the extension of the Hardy-Titchmarsh transform in the semilocal situation
involving a ﬁnite set S of places of Q containing the archimedean one, and the analysis of the
semilocal Sonin space. The semilocal version of Theorem 3.1 involves a new measure which, up to
normalization, is given by the square of the absolute value of the restriction to the critical line of
the product of local factors for the places in S.
To state this result we need the following notation (see section 4.1). The ring of semilocal adeles is

The computation of the coeﬃcients of the hermitian Jacobi matrix of the cyclic pair for a general S as
above is deferred to a forthcoming paper. In order to analyse the semilocal Sonin spaces we introduce
the dual Hardy-Titchmarsh transform in section 4.4. In the case of the single archimedan place this
transform was introduced by J-F. Burnol in connection with the work of L. de Branges. The main
result of this section is the construction of a hilbertian (2) isomorphism θS : L2(R)ev

which connects together the semilocal Sonin spaces:

This result suggests that the obtained invariantly deﬁned Sonin space should, when suitably equiped
with a prolate type operator, play the role of the sought for Weil cohomology. In fact we observed
in [12] that, in the case of the single archimedean place, the Sonin space corresponds (up to a
ﬁnite dimensional possible discrepancy) to the negative part of the spectrum of the prolate operator
and this gives another constraint in the search of the semilocal analogue of the prolate operator.
Moreover the results of [13] suggest a strong relation between orthogonal polynomials-which play a
key role in the semilocal case- and reproducing kernels commuting with diﬀerential operators.
Another conceptual point of view on the prolate operator is obtained in section 5. We show that
the prolate operator admits (still at the formal algebraic level) a description as an element of the
enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra of SL2(R) through the metaplectic representation of the

double cover of SL2(R). We compare this description of the prolate operator with Theorem 3.1
in section 5.2. We show that the generators of the metaplectic representation make sense in the
context of cyclic pairs i.e. equivalently of orthogonal polynomials. We prove (Theorem 5.2) that
the discrepency coeﬃcients dn vanish precisely in the situation of Theorem 3.1 and their vanishing
determines uniquely the cyclic pair (S, ξ

2. Cyclic pairs and associated prolate operators

N is
dense in H. Given such a pair we let En ⊂
n.
They are ﬁnite dimensional subspaces of H and dim En = n + 1, since the vectors Djξ are linearly
En+1 and the general situation is described as
independent. One has by construction D(En)

This deﬁnition is formal inasmuch as it does not give precisely the domain of the operator. We shall
see in section 3 that the standard prolate diﬀerential operator Wλ is a special case of deﬁnition 2.2.
It is clear in that case that the obtained formal operator is symmetric and ﬁnding the relevant
selfadjoint extension is delicate.

2.2. Jacobi matrix of the prolate operator of a cyclic pair. — At the formal level, i.e.
ignoring the issue of selfadjointness of D, an even cyclic pair is determined by the sequence (an)
which gives the Jacobi matrix of the operator D in the basis (ξn) by (9) while no longer assuming
that the an are real.



D =

One can then determine a Jacobi matrix representation for the formal prolate operator of Deﬁni-
tion 2.2. This operator commutes with the grading γ and thus is the direct sum of its restriction to
the eigenspaces H± :=
. These subspaces are generated by the vectors ξn where

the parity of n is ﬁxed. Indeed the square of the matrix of D is of the form (for n = 5)

We now give the matrix description of the formal prolate operator of Deﬁnition 2.2.

where s2 is the operator of multiplication by the square of the variable in L2(R, dm).

By construction the Hermite functions hn are themselves of the form hn(x) = Hn(x)h0(x) where the
Hn are orthogonal (and normalized) polynomials. Since the Fourier transform Fµ does not preserve
the product of functions nor their polynomial nature, Theorem 3.1 is by no means a consequence of
the construction of the Hermite functions. The operator U
U∗ is the multiplication by s while
the Hermite operator gives the grading. The main result is that, due to the functional equation
Γ(x + 1) = xΓ(x) of the Γ-function one has natural orthogonal polynomials governing the functions
U(h2n) where the hn are the normalized Hermite functions.

quadratic form associated to the Weil explicit formulas restricted to test functions supported in a
ﬁxed compact interval. The corresponding eigenfunctions were constructed using the image through
the map E of the positive spectrum of the prolate operator Wλ. We used these functions to condition
the canonical spectral triple of the circle in such a way that they belong to the kernel of the perturbed
the
Dirac operator and obtained the low lying zeros of the Riemann zeta function. For λ
eigenfunctions for positive eigenvalues of Wλ are approximated by the eigenfunctions of the operator

4.8. Hilbertian spaces of entire functions. — The stability exhibited by Theorem 4.6 shows
that the hilbertian structure of the Sonin spaces Sλ(XS , α) is independent of S and the theory of
Hilbert spaces of entire functions [3] in fact provides a canonical realization of these spaces which
we now describe. It is important to point out that the choice of the ﬁnite set S plays a key role in
ﬁxing the inner product in the Hilbertian space.

(iii) The coeﬃcients an agree with those given by proposition 3.3, after rescaling by powers of i.
(iv) The eigenvalues of σ(k), which serve as weights for the representation σ relative to the Cartan
SL(2, R), exactly reproduce the spectrum of the Hermite operator transported
subgroup
from L2(R)ev. This identiﬁes the irreducible representation σ as being the even component of the
metaplectic representation ̟ of

SL(2, R).

What one ﬁnds in general is that the denominators of the moments are 2n for c2n so that they are
determined by a sequence of integers. The ﬁrst ones are

1, 7, 139, 5473, 357721, 34988647, 4784061619, 871335013633, 203906055033841,

This is a classical integer sequence, known as A126156 [15]. In fact one has
