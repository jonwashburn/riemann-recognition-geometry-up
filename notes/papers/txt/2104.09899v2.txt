Abstract

We show that the spectral action, when perturbed by a gauge potential, can be written
as a series of Chern–Simons actions and Yang–Mills actions of all orders. In the odd orders,
generalized Chern–Simons forms are integrated against an odd (b, B)-cocycle, whereas, in the
even orders, powers of the curvature are integrated against (b, B)-cocycles that are Hochschild
cocycles as well. In both cases, the Hochschild cochains are derived from the Taylor series
expansion of the spectral action Tr( f (D + V)) in powers of V = πD(A), but unlike the Taylor
expansion we expand in increasing order of the forms in A. This extends [11], which computes
only the scale-invariant part of the spectral action, works in dimension at most 4, and assumes
the vanishing tadpole hypothesis. In our situation, we obtain a truly inﬁnite odd (b, B)-cocycle.
The analysis involved draws from recent results in multiple operator integration, which also
allows us to give conditions under which this cocycle is entire, and under which our expansion
is absolutely convergent. As a consequence of our expansion and of the gauge invariance of
the spectral action, we show that the odd (b, B)-cocycle pairs trivially with K1.

6 Gauge invariance and the pairing with K-theory

1 Introduction

The spectral action [2, 3] is one of the key instruments in the applications of noncommutative ge-
ometry to particle physics. With inner ﬂuctuations [10] of a noncommutative manifold playing
the role of gauge potentials, the spectral action principle yields Lagrangians for them. In fact, the
asymptotic behavior of the spectral action for small momenta leads in this way to local ﬁeld the-
ories. For example, this provides the simplest way known to geometrically explain the dynamics
and interactions of the gauge bosons and the Higgs boson in the Standard Model Lagrangian as
an effective ﬁeld theory [4] (see also the textbooks [13, 25]). These techniques extend to more gen-
eral noncommutative manifolds, and, indeed, if one restrict to the scale-invariant part, one may
naturally identify a Yang–Mills term and a Chern–Simons term to elegantly appear in the spectral
action [11]. However, it remains an open problem to determine the general form of the spectral
action without resorting to the scale-invariant part, even though from the physical perspective
there is a strong desire to go beyond this effective ﬁeld theory approach.

Motivated by this, we study the spectral action when it is expanded in terms of inner ﬂuc-
tuations associated to an arbitrary noncommutative manifold, without resorting to heat-kernel
techniques. Indeed, the latter are not always available and an understanding of the full spectral
action could provide deeper insight in the origin of these gauge theories from noncommutative
geometry. Let us now give a more precise description of our setup.

We let (A, H, D) be an s-summable spectral triple (cf. Deﬁnition 12 below). If f : R → C is a

suitably nice function we may deﬁne the spectral action [3]:

An inner ﬂuctuation, as explained in [10], is given by a Hermitian universal one-form

Tr( f (D)).

A =

n
∑
j=1

ajdbj ∈ Ω1(A),

for elements aj, bj ∈ A. The terminology ‘ﬂuctuation’ comes from representing A on H as

V := πD(A) :=

n
∑
j=1

aj[D, bj] ∈ B(H)sa,

(1)

(2)

and ﬂuctuating D to D + V in the spectral action. The variation of the spectral action under the
inner ﬂuctuation is then given by

Tr( f (D + V)) − Tr( f (D)).

(3)

As spectral triples can be understood as noncommutative spin manifolds encoding the gauge
ﬁelds as an inner structure, one could hope that perturbations of the spectral action could be un-
derstood in terms of noncommutative versions of geometrical, gauge theoretical concepts. Hence

2

we would like to express (3) in terms of universal forms constructed from A. To express an action
functional in terms of universal forms, one is naturally led to cyclic cohomology. As it turns out,
hidden inside the spectral action we will identify an odd (b, B)-cocycle ( ˜ψ1, ˜ψ3, . . .) and an even
(b, B)-cocycle (φ2, φ4, . . .) for which bφ2k = Bφ2k = 0, i.e., each Hochschild cochain φ2k forms its
own (b, B)-cocycle (0, . . . , 0, φ2k, 0, . . .). On the other hand, the odd (b, B)-cocycle ( ˜ψ2k+1) is truly
inﬁnite.

The main result of this paper is that for suitable f : R → C we may expand

Tr( f (D + V) − f (D)) =

in which the series converges absolutely. Here ψ2k−1 is a scalar multiple of ˜ψ2k−1, Ft = tdA + t2 A2,
so that F = F1 is the curvature of A, and cs2k−1(A) = (cid:82) 1
dt is a generalized noncommutative
Chern–Simons form. We also give a bound on the remainder of this expansion.

As already mentioned, a similar result was shown earlier to hold for the scale-invariant part
of the spectral action. Indeed, Connes and Chamseddine [11] expressed the scale-invariant part in
dimension ≤ 4 as

ζD+V(0) − ζD(0) = −

for a certain Hochschild 4-cocycle τ0 and cyclic 3-cocycle ψ.

Interestingly, a key role in our extension of this result to the full spectral action will be played
by multiple operator integrals. It is the natural replacement of residues in this context, and also
allows to go beyond dimension 4. For our analysis of the cocycle structure that appears in the full
spectral action we take the Taylor series expansion as a starting point. This explains the appear-
ance of multiple operator integrals, as traces thereof are multilinear extensions of the derivatives
of the spectral action. This viewpoint is also studied in [22, 24], where multiple operator integrals
are used to investigate the Taylor expansion of the spectral action. As we will show, multiple op-
erator integrals can also be used to deﬁne cyclic cocycles, because of some known properties of
the multiple operator integral that have been proved in increasing generality in the last decades
(e.g., in [1, 12, 17, 22, 24]). We push these results a bit further, in Section 3, by proving estimates
and continuity properties for the multiple operator integral when the self-adjoint operator has an
s-summable resolvent. Extending these results to the case of non-unital spectral triples is left open
for future research.

These techniques also allow us to show that the found (b, B)-cocycles are entire in the sense of
[8]. This makes it meaningful to analyze their pairing with K-theory, which we ﬁnd to be trivial in
Section 6.

Conventions

Throughout, we ﬁx a separable Hilbert space H. If we say D is self-adjoint in H, it is possibly
unbounded and self-adjoint with a domain dense in H. We let B(H) be the C*-algebra of bounded
operators on H. For M ⊆ B(H), Msa denotes the self-adjoint elements in M. We denote by
S s ⊆ B(H) the Schatten class of s-summable operators, for s ∈ N = {1, 2, . . .}. We write N0 =
{0, 1, 2, . . .}.

3

Universal forms When considering a spectral triple (A, H, D), we write Ω•(A) = ⊕n∈N
Ωn(A)
for the universal differential graded algebra over A =: Ω0(A), endowed with grading d. We
D(A) := πD(Ω1(A)) where πD : Ω1(A) → B(H) is deﬁned by (1) and (2). Whenever
write Ω1
A ∈ Ω1(A), we write F := dA + A2 ∈ Ω2(A) for the curvature of A.

0

Functions We write Cn for the space of n times continuously differentiable functions, C := C0,
C0 for the space of continuous functions vanishing at inﬁnity, Cn
c for the space of compactly sup-
ported functions in Cn, D := C∞
for the space of smooth compactly supported functions, S for
c
the Schwartz space, and Lp for the Lebesgue spaces (p ∈ [1, ∞]). All these functions are deﬁned
on R and have values in C. We deﬁne u(x) := x − i, and write u−1 for the multiplicative inverse
of u ∈ C.

dy

Fourier transforms We deﬁne the Fourier transform of an integrable function f on R by ˆf (x) :=
(cid:82)
2π f (y)e−iyx. For a general (not necessarily tempered) distribution f ∈ D(cid:48) we can still deﬁne the
R
Fourier transform as a distribution ˆf : ˆD → C by (cid:104) ˆf |ϕ(cid:105) := (cid:104) f | ˆϕ(cid:105) for all Schwartz functions ϕ with
ˆϕ ∈ D. The restriction ˆ : S (cid:48) → S (cid:48) is bijective with inverse denoted by ˇ : S (cid:48) → S (cid:48).

This more general deﬁnition of the Fourier transform will be applied in the following way. For
an arbitrary continuous function f (which is in D(cid:48) but not a priori in S (cid:48)) we will often assume that
ˆˇˆf = ˆf ,
ˆf ∈ L1. Because then ˆf ∈ S (cid:48) and ˇˆf ∈ C0 by the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma, we ﬁnd that
which implies (cid:104) f |ϕ(cid:105) = (cid:104) ˇˆf |ϕ(cid:105) for all ϕ ∈ D. Therefore f = ˇˆf ∈ C0 and f (x) = (cid:82) ˆf (y)eixy dy.

2 Preliminaries on multiple operator integrals

In this section, we introduce the subject of multiple operator integration in a sufﬁciently light way
to ﬁt our purposes. For a more extensive discussion, we refer to [1, 20, 23].

For every n ∈ N0 and f ∈ Cn, deﬁne the divided difference f [n] recursively as follows:

f [0](x0) := f (x0)

f [n+1](x0, . . . , xn+1) :=

(cid:40) f [n](x0,...,xn)− f [n](x0,...,xn−1,xn+1)
xn−xn+1
f [n](x0, . . . , xn)

∂
∂xn

if xn (cid:54)= xn+1
if xn = xn+1.

Let σ denote the standard measure on the n-simplex,

(cid:40)

∆n :=

(s0, . . . , sn) ∈ Rn+1
≥0

:

(cid:41)

sj = 1

.

n
∑
j=0

In order to deﬁne a multilinear operator integral, we need the following lemma.

Lemma 1. Whenever f ∈ Cn is such that (cid:100)f (n) ∈ L1, we can write f [n] as

f [n](x0, . . . , xn) =

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

∆n

R

eits0x0 · · · eitsn xn (cid:100)f (n)(t) dt dσ(s0, . . . , sn).

Proof. One simply combines the proofs of [20, Lemma 5.1] and [20, Lemma 5.2].

4

It is easily seen that (Σ, σf ) := (∆n × R, σ × (cid:100)f (n)) is a ﬁnite measure space with total variation

equal to 1

n! (cid:107)(cid:100)f (n)(cid:107)1.

Deﬁnition 2. Let D0 . . . , Dn be self-adjoint in H and let f ∈ Cn such that (cid:100)f (n) ∈ L1. The multiple
operator integral TD0,...,Dn

: B(H)×n → B(H) is deﬁned on V1, . . . , Vn ∈ B(H) by

f [n]

TD0,...,Dn
f [n]

(V1, . . . , Vn)y :=

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

∆n

R

eits0D0V1eits1D1 · · · Vneitsn Dn y (cid:100)f (n)(t) dt dσ(s0, . . . , sn),

(5)

for y ∈ H. In the case that Dj = D for all j, we also write TD

f [n] := TD,...,D

f [n]

.

This is a special case of the operator integral Tφ in [1, Deﬁnition 4.1] for the function φ = f [n].
We use the properties of Tφ proven there, e.g. we use [1, Lemma 4.3], to conclude that (5) does
not depend on the representation of f [n] as given by Lemma 1. We also note that (5) in particular
implies TD

f [0] = f (D).

An important property of the multiple operator integral TD
higher-order derivative of a trace functional like the spectral action:

f [n] is that it allows us to compute a

dn
dtn Tr( f (D + tV))(cid:12)

(cid:12)t=0

= Tr(TD

f [n] (V, . . . , V)),

(6)

see for instance [1, Theorem 5.7]. Under other assumptions, this formula is proven in [23, Theorem
5.3.5], [17, Theorem 3.12] and [20, equation (5.30)]. In other words, multiple operator integrals are
multilinear extensions of higher-order derivatives of the spectral action, which is why they are of
interest to us. We write the Taylor series expansion of the spectral action as

Tr( f (D + V)) ∼

∞
∑
n=0

Tr(TD

f [n] (V, . . . , V)).

(7)

The remainder of this Taylor series can be written in terms of a single multiple operator integral:

Proposition 3. For any K ∈ N0, let f ∈ CK+1 be such that (cid:100)f (n) ∈ L1 for n ∈ {0, . . . , K + 1}. Then

f (D + V) − f (D) −

Proof. The proof of [17, Theorem 3.13] exactly goes through for the stated class of functions.

The following lemma is an adaptation of [1, Lemma 4.6]. We give its proof for convenience of

the reader.
Lemma 4. Fix n ∈ N0 and f ∈ Cn such that (cid:100)f (n) ∈ L1, and let D0, . . . , Dn be self-adjoint in H. Suppose
α, αj ∈ [1, ∞] with 1

Proof. Assume that α < ∞. Deﬁne

As,t := eits0D0V1eits1D1 · · · Vneitsn Dn,

for all (s, t) ∈ ∆n × R = Σ. Using H ¨older’s inequality we ﬁnd that As,t ∈ S α and

Let B ∈ S α(cid:48)

be arbitrary, for α(cid:48) the H ¨older conjugate exponent of α. Deﬁne

g(s, t) := As,tB,

and notice that g : Σ → S 1 is uniformly S 1-bounded. For all j ≤ n, the map (s, t) (cid:55)→ eitsj Dj is
strongly continuous, and therefore g : Σ → S 1 is so*-continuous. By [1, Lemma 3.10], we obtain

When α = 1, simply taking a unitary B such that TD0,...,Dn
(V1, . . . , Vn)|
yields the result. If α ∈ (1, ∞), then an application of (S α(cid:48) )∗ = S α gives the result. If α = ∞, one
obtains the lemma directly by the triangle inequality

(V1, . . . , Vn)B = |TD0,...,Dn

Lemma 4 shows in particular that TD0,...,Dn

: B(H)×n → B(H) is (cid:107)·(cid:107)-continuous. When we
replace (B(H), (cid:107)·(cid:107)) by (B(H)1, s.o.t.), this is known to still hold true (see [1, Proposition 4.9]).
These results can be uniﬁed and generalized by writing Lα := (S α, (cid:107)·(cid:107)α) for α ∈ [1, ∞) and L∞
:=
(B(H)1, s.o.t.). We then have the following.

Lemma 5. Let f ∈ Cn with (cid:100)f (n) ∈ L1 and let α, αj ∈ [1, ∞] with 1

use the same technique and notation as in the proof of Lemma 4 to ﬁnd

is continuous for every p, q, r ∈ [1, ∞] with 1
also the product Lp × (Lq × Ls) → Lr is continuous whenever p, q, r, s ∈ [1, ∞] satisfy 1
s =

1
that the product

Lα1 × · · · × Lαn → Lα,

(V1, . . . , Vn) (cid:55)→ V1 · · · Vn

is continuous under the standing assumptions on α, αj. Hence, for every (s, t) ∈ Σ, the operator
As,tB ∈ L1 depends continuously on (V1, . . . , Vn) ∈ Lα1 × · · · × Lαn. Since a convergent sequence
in Lp is bounded w.r.t. (cid:107)·(cid:107)p (where (cid:107)·(cid:107)∞ = (cid:107)·(cid:107)) an application of the dominated convergence
theorem shows that (9) depends sequentially continuously on (V1, . . . , Vn). By our speciﬁc choice
of L∞

, every Lp is a metric space, hence sequential continuity implies continuity.

The relation 1

is central to the above Lemma. When the resolvent of D is s-
Schatten, however, for an explicit class W s,n of functions f , deﬁned in Section 3, we can do away
with this relation. We will prove this in §3.2.

3 Estimating the multiple operator integral in the s-summable case

We specialize the class of functions f that appear in Proposition 3 and consider for s, n ∈ N0:

W s,n := { f ∈ Cn :

( f um)(k) ∈ L1 for all m ≤ s and k ≤ n},

where u(x) := x − i. Examples of functions in W s,n are n + 1-differentiable functions such that
( f us)(k) ∈ L2 for all k ≤ n + 1, such as Schwartz functions, or functions in Cn+1

The main result of this section will be the following bound on the multiple operator integral.
Theorem 6. Let D be self-adjoint in H such that (D − i)−1 ∈ S s for s ∈ N. For every n ∈ N0, every
f ∈ W s,n and every V1, . . . , Vn ∈ B(H), the multiple operator integral TD
f [n] (V1, . . . , Vn) is trace-class and

This theorem allows us to freely work with the traces of multiple operator integrals up to
order n. This is the sole analytical ingredient for a truncated version of our main result, namely
Theorem 29. However, if we want the expansion (4) to converge, we will need to impose inﬁnite

7

differentiability of f , as well as a growth condition on the L1-norms occurring in Theorem 6, as n
goes to inﬁnity. We therefore introduce the space

certain perturbations A. If γ = 1, the expansion converges absolutely whenever the perturbation
A is sufﬁciently small. If γ < 1 the expansion converges absolutely for all perturbations. The
following Lemma underlies both results.
Lemma 7. Let s ∈ N, D self-adjoint in H with (D − i)−1 ∈ S s, and γ ∈ (0, 1]. For any f ∈ E s,γ there

Proof. Apply the deﬁnition of E s,γ to Theorem 6, and absorb 2s into the constant C.

This lemma will be used in Subsection 5.2 and Section 6.
Examples of functions in E s,1 are Schwartz functions with compactly supported Fourier trans-

form. The following proposition gives more examples.
Proposition 8. Let f ∈ C∞ and s, t ∈ N0.

(i) If f ∈ E s,1 and g ∈ E t,1, then f g ∈ E s+t,1.

(ii) If ˆf ∈ L1 with | ˆf (x)| ≤ e−c|x| a.e. for some c > 0, then f ∈ E 0,1.

(iii) If (cid:100)f us ∈ L1 with |(cid:100)f us(x)| ≤ e−c|x| a.e. for some c > 0, then f ∈ E s,1.

(iv) Rational functions in O(|x|−s−1) are in E s,1.

(v) The function x (cid:55)→ e−x2

is in E s,1/2 for any s ∈ N0.

Proof.

3.1 Bound on the multiple operator integral

We will now give a proof of Theorem 6, which uses the summability of D to obtain a trace class
estimate on the multiple operator integral TD
f [n]. For summability s = 2, a similar estimate was
found by Anna Skripka in [22, Lemma 3.6]. This was later generalized to the case of so-called
relative Schatten perturbations in [17, Theorem 3.10], but only holds for k-multilinear operator
integrals of order k ≥ s.

The core idea of our proof is the same as of [22, Lemma 3.6] and [17, Theorem 3.10], namely to
expand Tf [n] (V1, . . . , Vn) as a sum of operator integrals, which should then be bounded using the
triangle inequality and (a noncommutative) H ¨older’s inequality. For brevity, we sometimes write

In the ﬁrst term we can freely replace the sum from k = 0 to min(s, n) by a sum from k = 0 to
min(s + 1, n), because the appearing sum over j0, . . . , jk is trivial for k = s + 1. Similarly, in the
second term, we can freely let k run from 0 to min(s + 1, n). Combining the two terms gives the
claim of the lemma for s + 1, which completes the induction step.

We prove the main result of this section.

3.2 Continuity of the multiple operator integral
Theorem 10. Let s ∈ N, D self-adjoint in H with (D − i)−1 ∈ S s, n ∈ N0, and f ∈ W s,n. The map

is continuous. (Recall that L∞ = B(H)1, endowed with the strong operator topology.)

f [n] : L∞ × · · · × L∞ → L1
TD

Proof. Suppose that Vm

1 → V1, . . . , Vm

n → Vn in L∞

. By continuity of (10), we obtain that

We invoke Lemma 5 to ﬁnd that

in Ls/j0.

By Lemma 9 and the continuity of the product (11) (for which we remark that the assumptions on
αj, α are indeed satisﬁed for all terms obtained from Lemma 9) we ﬁnd that

TD
f [n] (Vm

so we are done.

To emphasize the strength of this result, we compare it to Lemma 5 which is (at least in the
separate cases α1, . . . , αn < ∞ and α = ∞) known in the literature. Using the continuity of the
inclusion Lα (cid:44)→ L∞
Corollary 11. Let s ∈ N, D self-adjoint in H with (D − i)−1 ∈ S s, n ∈ N0, and f ∈ W s,n. For any
α1, . . . , αn ∈ [1, ∞] and any α ∈ [1, ∞] (no relation between α and the αj’s assumed) the map

we obtain the following clear improvement.

4 Cyclic cocycles and universal forms underlying the spectral action

Mainly to ﬁx our conventions, we start with the deﬁnition of a ﬁnitely summable spectral triple,
which is the situation in which our main result is stated.
Deﬁnition 12. Let s ∈ N. An s-summable spectral triple (A, H, D) consists of a separable Hilbert
space H, a self-adjoint operator D in H and a unital *-algebra A ⊆ B(H), such that, for all a ∈ A,
a dom D ⊆ dom D and [D, a] extends to a bounded operator, and (D − i)−1 ∈ S s.

Throughout this section, we let (A, H, D) be an s-summable spectral triple for s ∈ N, and we

let f ∈ W s,n for n ∈ N0, unless stated otherwise.
Deﬁnition 13. Deﬁne a multilinear function (cid:104)·(cid:105) : B(H)×n → C by

(cid:104)V1, . . . , Vn(cid:105) :=

n
∑
j=1

Tr(TD

f [n] (Vj, . . . , Vn, V1, . . . , Vj−1)).

(12)

11

For our algebraic results (which make up most of Section 4 and §5.1) we only need two simple
properties of the bracket (cid:104)·(cid:105), stated in the following lemma. After proving this lemma, all ana-
lytical subtleties (related to the unboundedness of D) are taken care of, and we can focus on the
algebra that ensues from these simple rules.

Lemma 14. For V1, . . . , Vn ∈ B(H) and a ∈ A we have

(I) (cid:104)V1, . . . , Vn(cid:105) = (cid:104)Vn, V1, . . . , Vn−1(cid:105),

(II) (cid:104)V1, . . . , aVj, . . . , Vn(cid:105) − (cid:104)V1, . . . , Vj−1a, . . . , Vn(cid:105) = (cid:104)V1, . . . , Vj−1, [D, a], Vj, . . . , Vn(cid:105),

where it is understood that for the edge case j = 1 we need to substitute n for j − 1 on the left-hand side,
and f ∈ W s,n+1 is assumed to deﬁne the right-hand side.

Proof. Property (I) follows immediately from Deﬁnition 13. By writing out the deﬁnitions for
rank-1 operators V1, . . . , Vn, we have,

f [n] (V1, . . . , Vj, aVj+1, . . . , Vn) − TD
TD
= TD

f [n+1] (V1, . . . , Vj, [D, a], Vj+1, . . . , Vn),

f [n] (V1, . . . , Vja, Vj+1, . . . , Vn)

and the two edge cases,

TD
f [n] (aV1, . . . , Vn) − aTD
f [n] (V1, . . . , Vn)a − TD
TD

f [n] (V1, . . . , Vn) = TD
f [n] (V1, . . . , Vna) = TD

f [n+1] ([D, a], V1, . . . , Vn),
f [n+1] (V1, . . . , Vn, [D, a]).

(13)

(14)

(15)

By Theorem 10, and the fact that the ﬁnite-rank operators lie strongly dense in B(H), we ﬁnd that
formulas (13) , (14) and (15) hold for all V1, . . . , Vn ∈ B(H). Hence,

(cid:104)aV1, V2, . . . , Vn(cid:105) − (cid:104)V1, V2, . . . , Vna(cid:105)

Tr(TD

f [n] (Vj, . . . , Vn, [D, a], V1, . . . , Vj−1))

f [n+1] (V1, . . . , Vn, [D, a]))

= (cid:104)[D, a], V1, . . . , Vn(cid:105),

and therefore (II) follows by applying (I).

12

Remark 15. Under additional assumptions – for instance when V1, . . . , Vn ∈ S 1 and f ∈ W s,n is such
that f (cid:48) is compactly supported and analytic in a region of C containing a rectiﬁable curve γ which surrounds
the support of f in R – we have

This occurs in [24, Corl. 20] in the case where V1 = V2 = · · · = Vn. It would be interesting to confront
these resolvent formulas with the ones appearing in the work of Paycha [19].

4.1 Hochschild and cyclic cocycles

When the above brackets (cid:104)·(cid:105) are evaluated at one-forms a[D, b] associated to a spectral triple,
the relations found in Lemma 14 can be translated nicely in terms of the coboundary operators
appearing in cyclic cohomology. This is very similar to the structure appearing in the context of
index theory, see for instance [15, 16].

Let us start by recalling the deﬁnition of the boundary operators b and B from [7].

Deﬁnition 16. If A is an algebra, and n ∈ N0, we deﬁne the space of Hochschild n-cochains, denoted
by C n(A), as the space of (n + 1)-linear functionals φ on A with the property that if aj = 1 for some j ≥ 1,
then φ(a0, . . . , an) = 0. Deﬁne operators b : C n(A) → C n+1(A) and B : C n+1(A) → C n(A) by

bφ(a0, a1, . . . , an+1) :=

Bφ(a0, a1, . . . , an) :=

(−1)jφ(a0, . . . , ajaj+1, . . . , an+1)

n
∑
j=0
+ (−1)n+1φ(an+1a0, a1, . . . , an),
n
∑
j=0

(−1)njφ(1, aj, aj+1, . . . , aj−1).

Note that B = AB0 in terms of the operator A of cyclic anti-symmetrization and the operator

deﬁned by B0φ(a0, a1, . . . , an) = φ(1, a0, a1, . . . , an).

One may check that the pair (b, B) deﬁnes a double complex, i.e. b2 = 0, B2 = 0 and bB + Bb =
0. Hochschild cohomology then arises as the cohomology of the complex (C n(A), b), while the
for us relevant periodic cyclic cohomology is deﬁned as the cohomology of the totalization of the
(b, B)-complex. That is to say,

Cev(A) = (cid:77)
k

C2k(A);

Codd(A) = (cid:77)
k

C2k+1(A),

form a complex with differential b + B and the cohomology of this complex is called periodic cyclic
cohomology. We will also refer to a periodic cyclic cocycle as a (b, B)-cocycle. Explicitly, an odd
(b, B)-cocycle is thus given by a sequence

where φ2k+1 ∈ C2k+1(A) and

(φ1, φ3, φ5, . . .),

bφ2k+1 + Bφ2k+3 = 0,

for all k ≥ 0, and also Bφ1 = 0. An analogous statement holds for even (b, B)-cocycles.

13

4.2 Cyclic cocycles associated to multiple operator integrals

We deﬁne the following Hochschild n-cochain:

φn(a0, . . . , an) := (cid:104)a0[D, a1], [D, a2], . . . , [D, an](cid:105)

(a0, . . . , an ∈ A).

(16)

We easily see that B0φn is invariant under cyclic permutations, so that Bφn = nB0φn for odd n and
Bφn = 0 for even n. Also, φn(a0, . . . , an) = 0 when aj = 1 for some j ≥ 1. We put φ0 := 0.
Lemma 17. We have bφn = φn+1 for odd n and we have bφn = 0 for even n.

Proof. As bφ0 = 0 by deﬁnition, and b2 = 0, we need only check the case in which n is odd.
We ﬁnd, by splitting up the sum, and shifting the second appearing sum by one, that

bφn(a0, . . . , an+1)

= (cid:104)a0a1[D, a1], [D, a2], . . . , [D, an+1](cid:105) − (cid:104)a0a1[D, a1], [D, a2], . . . , [D, an+1](cid:105)

= φn+1(a0, . . . , an+1),

by (I) and (II) of Lemma 14.

Lemma 18. Let n be even. We have bB0φn = 2φn − B0φn+1.

Proof. Splitting the sum in two, and shifting the index of the second sum, we ﬁnd

bB0φn(a0, . . . , an) =

(−1)j(cid:104)[D, a0], . . . , aj[D, aj+1], . . . , [D, an](cid:105)

2 B0φ2k,

Bψ2k+1 = 2(2k + 1)bψ2k−1.

We can rephrase this property in terms of the (b, B)-complex as follows.
Proposition 19. Let φn and ψ2k−1 be as deﬁned above and set ˜ψ2k−1 := (−1)k−1 (k−1)!

(2k−1)! ψ2k−1.

1. The sequence (φ2k) is a (b, B)-cocycle and each φ2k deﬁnes an even Hochschild cocycle: bφ2k = 0.

2. The sequence ( ˜ψ2k−1) is an odd (b, B)-cocycle.

We use an integral notation that is deﬁned by linear extension of

4.3 Derivatives of the spectral action in terms of universal forms

In this section we will express the derivatives of the ﬂuctuated spectral action (occurring in the
Taylor series) in terms of universal forms that are integrated along φ. We thus make the jump from
D(A)sa to an expression in terms of A ∈ Ω1(A). By (6)
an expression in terms of V = πD(A) ∈ Ω1
and the deﬁnition of (cid:104)V, . . . , V(cid:105), we have, for n ∈ N,

(17)

As V decomposes as a ﬁnite sum V = ∑ aj[D, bj], our task is to express (cid:104)aj1[D, bj1], . . . , ajn [D, bjn ](cid:105)
in terms of universal forms a0da1 · · · dan integrated along φ. This will turn out to be possible by
just using (II) and [D, a1a2] = a1[D, a2] + [D, a1]a2. To ﬁnd the exact expression we need to work
in the algebra M2(Ω•(A)) = M2(C) ⊗ Ω•(A).
Proposition 20. Let n ∈ N. For a1, . . . , an, b1, . . . , bn ∈ A, denoting Aj := ajdbj, we have

(cid:104)a1[D, b1], . . . , an[D, bn](cid:105) =

Proof. If we combine, for every n ∈ N0, the n-multilinear function (cid:104)·(cid:105) from (12), we obtain a linear
function

(cid:104)·(cid:105) : TB(H) → C

on the tensor algebra TB(H). For any ω, ν ∈ TB(H), a straightforward calculation using the
commutation rule (II) from Lemma 14 shows that

(cid:104)ω ⊗ aj−1[D, bj−1] ⊗ (cid:0)aj

ajbj

(cid:1) ν(cid:105) = (cid:104)ω ⊗ (cid:0)aj−1

(cid:1) Mj ⊗ ν(cid:105),

(18)

where Mj ∈ M2(TB(H)) is deﬁned by

−[D, aj]

[D, bj−1ajbj] + [D, bj−1] ⊗ [D, ajbj]

(cid:19)

.

(19)

Repeating (18), and subsequently using (16), it follows that

(cid:104)a1[D, b1], . . . , an[D, bn](cid:105) = (cid:104)a1[D, b1] ⊗ . . . ⊗ an−1[D, bn−1] ⊗ (cid:0)an

Notice that, if φ4 would be tracial, we would be able to identify the terms dAA2, AdAA and A2dA, and
thus obtain the Yang–Mills form F2 = (dA + A2)2, under the fourth integral. In the general case, however,
cyclic permutations under (cid:82)

φ produce correction terms, of which we will need to keep track.

4.4 Near-tracial behavior of (cid:82)

φ

In §4.3, we have not used the cyclicity property (I) from Lemma 14. Doing so yields the following
proposition, which shows how (cid:82)
φ differs from being tracial. This proposition and its corollary are
crucial for Section 5.

For a universal n-form X ∈ Ωn(A), deﬁne odd(X) := 1 if n is odd, and odd(X) := 0 if n is

even.

Proposition 23. Let X and Y be universal forms. Then

Doing the same for (cid:82)

4.5 Higher-order generalized Chern–Simons forms

As a ﬁnal preparation for our main result, we brieﬂy recall from [21] the deﬁnition of Chern–
Simons forms.
Deﬁnition 25. Let (Ω•, d) be a differential graded algebra. The Chern–Simons form of degree 2k − 1 is
given for A ∈ Ω1 by

cs2k−1(A) :=

A(Ft)k−1dt,

(21)

(cid:90) 1

0

where Ft = tdA + t2 A2 is the curvature two-form of the (connection) one-form At = tA.

We will only work with the universal differential graded algebra Ω• = Ω•(A) for the algebra

A.

Example 26. For the ﬁrst three Chern–Simons forms one easily derives the following explicit expressions:

cs1(A) = A;

cs3(A) =

5 Expansion of the spectral action in terms of (b, B)-cocycles

In this section we prove our main theorem.

Theorem 27. Let (A, H, D) be an s-summable spectral triple, and let f ∈ E s,γ for γ ∈ (0, 1). The spectral
action ﬂuctuated by V = πD(A) ∈ Ω1

Tr( f (D + V) − f (D)) =

D(A)sa can be written as

cs2k−1(A) +

ψ2k−1

(cid:90)

2k

(cid:19)

Fk

where the series converges absolutely.

We prove this theorem in two steps. Firstly, we deal with the algebraic part of this statement,
in §5.1. Here we only need to assume f ∈ W s,n for a ﬁnite n ∈ N. Secondly, in §5.2, we tackle
the analytical part. We there obtain a strong estimate on the remainder of the above expansion
in Theorem 33 for a function f ∈ E s,γ for general γ ∈ (0, 1]. This estimate will imply that the
conclusion of Theorem 27 still holds in the case of γ = 1, when the perturbation V is sufﬁciently
small. When f ∈ E s,γ for γ ∈ (0, 1), the expansion follows for all perturbations, and thus we prove
Theorem 27.

5.1 Truncated expansion
Let K ∈ N, f ∈ W s,2K, and V = πD(A) ∈ Ω1
D(A)sa. We prove a truncated version of Theorem 27,
showing that the ﬂuctuation of the spectral action can be expressed in terms of Chern–Simons and
Yang–Mills forms, up to a remainder which involves forms of degree higher than K. To enumerate
the remainder forms we use the index set

Proof. We start with the 2x2 matrix equation from Corollary 21 and separate the 1-forms A from
the two-forms dA. The n-th term in the Taylor expansion of Tr( f (D + V)) is given (by use of (17)
and Corollary 21) by

. The α’s and β’s have very nice alge-

braic properties, which can be used to regroup the terms in the expansion in n. When summing
(23) from n = 1 to inﬁnity, and grouping the universal forms by their degree as in Example 22,
we need some machinery to keep track of the coefﬁcient 1/n. We will work in the space of (ﬁ-
nite) polynomials M2(Ω•(A))[t], and deﬁne an integration with respect to t as the linear map
(cid:82) 1
0 dt : M2(Ω•(A))[t] → M2(Ω•(A)) given by integration of polynomials. We thus obtain

(25)

We can summarize the identities involving α and β that we will use as

α2 = 1;
et
1(αβα)e1 = 0;

β2 = β;
et
1(αβ)e1 = 0;

βαβ = 0;
et
1(βα)e1 = 1;

et
1(α)e1 = 1;
et
1(β)e1 = 1.

From these identities follow the following two remarks:

• If k ≥ 2 and vi is odd for a certain i ∈ {2, . . . , k}, then somewhere in αv1 βw1 · · · αvk βwk αp a

factor βαβ = 0 occurs, so in particular

et
1(αv1 βw1 · · · αvk βwk αp)e1 = 0.

• If v1 is odd and v2, . . . , vk are all even, then

1(αv1 βw1 · · · αvk βwk αp)e1 = et
et

1(αβαp)e1 = 0.

20

Therefore, for all k ≥ 0, we conclude that in (25) only terms remain in which v1, . . . , vk are even.
In fact, we ﬁnd

We will ﬁrst show that the second term of (29) vanishes. We use the following rule, which allows
us to replace the integrand by a form which is two degrees lower.

We prove a strong bound on the asymptotic expansion given by Theorem 29, in particular giving
sufﬁcient conditions for the series to converge, effectively replacing ∼ by =. A crucial ingredient
is Lemma 7.
Theorem 33. Let (A, H, D) be an s-summable spectral triple, let n ∈ N, and ﬁx f ∈ E s,γ for γ ∈
(0, 1]. Then there exists C f ,s,n,γ such that, for A = ∑n

f ∈ E s,γ, γ < 1.
Corollary 34. Let (A, H, D) be an s-summable spectral triple, let f ∈ E s,1 and V = πD(A) ∈ Ω1

the corollary follows.

Proof of Theorem 27. This follows from Theorem 33 by taking γ < 1.

6 Gauge invariance and the pairing with K-theory

Since the spectral action is a spectral invariant, it is in particular invariant under conjugation of D
by a unitary in the algebra A. More generally, in the presence of an inner ﬂuctuation we ﬁnd that
the spectral action is invariant under the transformation

D + V (cid:55)→ u(D + V)u∗ = D + Vu;

Vu = u[D, u∗] + uVu∗.

This transformation also holds at the level of the universal forms, with a gauge transformation of
the form A (cid:55)→ Au = udu∗ + uAu∗. Let us analyze the behavior of the Chern–Simons and Yang–
Mills terms appearing in Theorem 27 under this gauge transformation, and derive an interesting
consequence for the pairing between the odd (b, B)-cocycle ˜ψ with the odd K-theory group of A.
Lemma 35. The Yang–Mills terms (cid:82)
tion A (cid:55)→ Au for every k ≥ 1.

Fk with F = dA + A2 are invariant under the gauge transforma-

φ2k

Proof. Since the curvature of Au is simply given by uFu∗, the claim follows from Corollary 24(i).

We are thus led to the conclusion that the Chern–Simons forms are gauge invariant as well.
Indeed, arguing as in [11], since both Tr f (D + V) and the Yang-Mills terms are invariant under
V (cid:55)→ Vu, we ﬁnd that, under the assumptions stated in Theorem 27:

(cid:90)

∑
k=0

ψ2k+1

cs2k+1(Au) =

(cid:90)

∞
∑
k=0

ψ2k+1

cs2k+1(A).

Each individual Chern–Simons form behaves non-trivially under a gauge transformation. Never-
theless, it turns out that we can conclude, just as in [11], that the pairing of the whole (b, B)-cocycle
with K-theory is trivial. Since the (b, B)-cocycle ˜ψ is given as an inﬁnite sequence, we should ﬁrst
carefully study the analytical behavior of ˜ψ. In fact, we should show that it is an entire cyclic cocycle
in the sense of [8] (see also [9, Section IV.7.α]). For this purpose, we can without loss of generality
assume that A is complete in the Banach algebra norm deﬁned by (cid:107)a(cid:107)1 := (cid:107)a(cid:107) + (cid:107)[D, a](cid:107), because
(cid:107)·(cid:107)1) is an extension of the
(A
one in C2k+1(A). Recall that for Banach algebras A an odd cochain such as ˜ψ is called entire if

(cid:107)·(cid:107)1, H, D) is also a spectral triple, and the resulting ˜ψ2k+1 ∈ C2k+1(A

the power series ∑k
IV.7.7a,c] to the condition that for any bounded subset Σ ⊂ A there exists a constant CΣ so that

(cid:107) ˜ψ2k+1(cid:107)zk converges everywhere in C. This is equivalent [9, Remark

(2k+1)!
k!

| ˜ψ2k+1(a0, . . . , a2k+1)| ≤

CΣ
k!

(∀aj ∈ Σ).

In our case it turns out that Lemma 7 implies the following growth condition, guaranteeing that
indeed ˜ψ is entire.
Lemma 36. Fix f ∈ E s,γ for γ < 1 and equip A with the norm (cid:107)a(cid:107)1 = (cid:107)a(cid:107) + (cid:107)[D, a](cid:107). Then, for any
bounded subset Σ ⊂ A there exists CΣ such that

| ˜ψ2k+1(a0, . . . , a2k+1)| ≤

CΣ
k!

,

for all aj ∈ Σ.

Proof. Assume that (cid:107)aj(cid:107)1 ≤ R for all aj ∈ Σ so that both (cid:107)aj(cid:107), (cid:107)[D, aj](cid:107) ≤ R. By deﬁnition of φ,
the expression ψ2k+1(a0, . . . , a2k+1) is given by a linear combination of multiple operator integrals
with arguments in {V ∈ B(H) : (cid:107)V(cid:107) ≤ R} except for a0[D, a1], which is bounded by R2. By
applying Lemma 7, we obtain the estimate

We recall from Proposition 19 that

so that (34) in particular implies the lemma by use of, for instance, Stirling’s approximation.

where ˜ψq
2k+1 := Tr # ˜ψ2k+1 : (µ0 ⊗ a0, . . . , µ2k+1 ⊗ a2k+1) (cid:55)→ Tr(µ0 · · · µ2k+1) ˜ψ2k+1(a0, . . . , a2k+1) for
µ0, . . . , µ2k+1 ∈ Mq(C) and a0, . . . , a2k+1 ∈ A. Since ˜ψ is a (b, B)-cocycle, it follows from [9, Corol-
lary IV.7.27] (see also [9, Sections III.3 and IV.7]) that this pairing only depends on the class of u in
K1(A).
Theorem 37. Let f ∈ E s,γ for γ < 1. Then the pairing of the odd entire cyclic cocycle ˜ψ with K1(A) is
trivial, i.e.

for all unitary u ∈ Mq(A).

(cid:104)u, ˜ψ(cid:105) = 0

Proof. Apply Theorem 27 to a bigger spectral triple, namely (Aq, Hq, Dq) := (Mq(C) ⊗ A, Cq ⊗
H, Iq ⊗ D). Take A = u∗du for u unitary in Mq(A) = Mq(C) ⊗ A. Clearly, then V = u∗[Dq, u],
and because the multiple operator integral behaves naturally with respect to tensor products, we
obtain

Tr( f (Dq + u∗[Dq, u]) − f (Dq)) =

where F = d(u∗du) + (u∗du)2 = 0. Also notice that the left-hand side equals Tr( f (u∗Dqu) −

From the deﬁnition of the Chern–Simons form (Deﬁnition 25) and the fact that Ft = tdA + t2 A2 =
(t − t2)dA + t2F = (t − t2)du∗du we ﬁnd that

cs2k+1(u∗du) =

(cid:90) 1

dt (t − t2)ku∗dudu∗du · · · du∗du,

so that by a straightforward integration we may conclude that

Combining this with (35), (36) and (37), the theorem follows.
