From Bernoulli Numbers to Selector Kernels:
Fredholm Determinants, ζ–Regularization, and the Bridge
Between Discrete and Continuous Spectra

Ken Nagai∗

Abstract

We construct a unified analytic framework connecting Bernoulli numbers, ζ–regularization,
and Fredholm determinants associated with trigonometric selector kernels. Starting from the
Bernoulli–Stirling algebra, Euler–Maclaurin corrections are reinterpreted as spectral traces of
compact operators. This bridge transforms discrete combinatorial data into continuous spec-
tral quantities, showing that their determinants interpolate between finite–rank projectors
and the sine–kernel of random–matrix theory. In the continuum limit the Fredholm determi-
nant becomes a Painlevé–V τ –function, revealing a hierarchy in which Bernoulli coefficients
and ζ–constants jointly describe the local–global asymptotics of analytic regularization.

Introduction and Motivation

The purpose of this note is to clarify how three apparently distant frameworks—Bernoulli num-
bers and the Euler–Maclaurin formula, ζ–regularization of spectral products, and Fredholm
determinants of trigonometric kernels—form parts of a single analytic bridge between discrete
and continuous mathematics.

Historically, Bernoulli numbers emerged as the coefficients that correct an integral approxi-

mation of a finite sum,

(1.1)

Each B2m measures how the discrete sum deviates from its continuum integral (see [6] for his-
torical background). When the same coefficients reappear in the short–time asymptotics of heat
kernels, they acquire a spectral meaning: they quantify how discrete eigenvalues approximate a
continuous spectrum.

In parallel, ζ–regularized determinants Detζ A = exp[−ζ ′

A(0)] extend products of eigenvalues
to infinite–dimensional settings, while Fredholm determinants detF (I + λT ) compactly encode
all spectral moments of trace–class operators.

The central message is that these constructions are not merely analogous but are algebraic
shadows of a common mechanism: regularization as analytic continuation. Bernoulli numbers
act locally (corrections near the diagonal), ζ–regularization acts globally (over spectra), and
Fredholm determinants mediate between the two.

Aim. We reinterpret the Bernoulli–Stirling algebra as a discrete prototype of a Fredholm inte-
λ and
gral operator. Its regularized determinant reproduces the trigonometric factors sin

λ from the Gelfand–Yaglom formula[1], while its periodicized version becomes the finite–
rank selector kernel whose large–J limit is the sine kernel of random–matrix theory[3].

2 Bernoulli–Stirling Continuation

The Bernoulli and Stirling numbers form dual triangular arrays that connect finite differences
with power sums[6]. Their analytic continuation naturally leads to kernel–like integral forms.

For α ∈ C, define

(2.1)

At α = 1 one recovers the classical Bernoulli polynomials Bn(x) = B(1)
α = −k, these yield the Stirling numbers of the second kind:

n (x). At negative integers,

S(n, k) =

Example 2.1 (Quick check). For (n, k) = (3, 2) one finds B(−2)
as expected from the combinatorial definition.

2.2 Analytic kernel representation

Analytic continuation extends S(n, k) to complex arguments (s, t) via

S(s, t) =

where γ is a small contour around z = 0. For integer (s, t) this reproduces the discrete Stirling
matrix, while for complex parameters it defines the smooth analytic Stirling kernel

K(s, t) =

Γ(s + 1)
Γ(t + 1)

1
2πi

(cid:73)

γ

Remark 2.2 (From array to operator). Equation (2.2) converts a combinatorial array into an
integral kernel whose finite truncations reproduce discrete matrices and whose continuum limits
yield trace–class operators. It is, in effect, the analytic extension of the Stirling table.

2.3 Exponent–to–angle substitution

Introducing the trigonometric parametrization

ez − 1 = 2i eiθ/2 sin

θ ∈ [−π, π],

transforms (2.2) into a kernel with oscillatory phase ei(2m+1)(θ−φ)/2. This is precisely the struc-
ture of the finite–J selector kernel

SJ (θ, φ) =

1
J

J−1
(cid:88)

m=0

ei(2m+1)(θ−φ)/2.

Hence the Stirling kernel under the map (2.3) acts as a continuous generating function for the
trigonometric selectors that govern finite spectral projections.

Remark 2.3 (Takeaway). The Bernoulli–Stirling algebra is the discrete skeleton of a Fredholm
theory: its generating functions already possess the contour integrals and trigonometric phases
that become kernels, resolvents, and determinants in the continuum limit.

3 From Finite Matrices to Fredholm Operators

The passage from finite combinatorial data to analytic operator formulations follows the same
pattern as the limit from discrete sums to integrals. Finite arrays such as the Stirling matrix can
be viewed as Gram matrices of basis functions, which in the continuum limit become integral
kernels acting on a Hilbert space.

3.1 Matrices, kernels, and the continuum limit

A matrix represents a linear map between finite–dimensional spaces. When the dimension tends
to infinity, the same algebraic intuition remains valid if we replace column vectors by square–
integrable functions on an interval. Symbolically,

vectors (vk) −→ f (x),

sums

The correspondence is summarized in Fig. 4.

entries ⇒ continuous variables

Figure 4: Matrix → kernel correspondence: as dimension grows, discrete indices (j, k) become
continuous variables (x, y).

Given a continuous kernel K(x, y) on [0, 1]2, define the integral operator

(T f )(x) =

(cid:90) 1

0

K(x, y)f (y) dy.

(3.1)

This operator plays the role of an infinite matrix. When K(x, y) = K(y, x), the operator is
self–adjoint.

Example 3.1 (A canonical kernel). For K(x, y) = min(x, y) one finds

(T f )(x) =

3.2 Traces and determinants

For a finite n × n matrix A with eigenvalues µi,

Tr(A) =

(cid:88)

µi,

i

det(I + λA) =

n
(cid:89)

i=1

(1 + λµi).

If the operator T in (3.1) is trace–class (that is, (cid:80)

j |µj| < ∞), both quantities extend naturally:

Tr(T ) =

(cid:88)

j≥1

µj,

detF (I + λT ) =

(cid:89)

(1 + λµj).

j≥1

The second expression defines the Fredholm determinant.

Definition 3.2 (Fredholm determinant). Let T be a trace–class operator on a separable Hilbert
space H with eigenvalues {µj}. The Fredholm determinant of I + λT is defined by

detF (I + λT ) = exp

Remark 3.3 (Analogy to the zeta determinant). The series in (3.2) mirrors ζA(s) = (cid:80)
j λ−s
:
j
both encode spectral data through power sums of eigenvalues. The Fredholm determinant regu-
larizes products, while ζ–regularization acts on sums.

3.3 The Fredholm alternative

If K is a compact operator on a Banach space X, then for any λ ∈ C,

(I − λK)f = g

has a solution f if and only if g is orthogonal to all solutions of the adjoint homogeneous equation
(I − λK∗)h = 0. Either (I − λK) is invertible or the homogeneous equation has nontrivial
solutions, but not both.
In finite dimensions this reduces to the statement that a matrix is
invertible iff its determinant is nonzero; for compact operators the Fredholm determinant in (3.2)
plays the same role.

3.4 Finite–rank intuition

Two simple examples illustrate the analogy between finite matrices and their operator limits.

5

Example 3.4 (Rank–one kernel). If T = α u⊗v with (T f )(x) = α ⟨f, v⟩u, then T 2 = α ⟨u, v⟩T
and T has one nonzero eigenvalue µ = α ⟨u, v⟩. Hence

detF (I + λT ) = 1 + λµ.

This recovers the expected linear determinant for a rank–one matrix.

Example 3.5 (Orthogonal projector). Let P be a rank–r projection (P 2 = P , P ∗ = P ). Then
Spec(P ) = {1} of multiplicity r, and

detF (I − λP ) = (1 − λ)r.

Such projectors approximate finite–band selectors in the trigonometric kernel examples below.

3.5 Operator traces and Bernoulli echoes

For trace–class T , the power traces Tr(T n) entering (3.2) act as spectral moments. When T is de-
rived from a smooth kernel, Tr(T n) can be expressed as multiple integrals of K(x1, x2) · · · K(xn, x1).
In discretized form these reduce to finite sums—and once again Bernoulli numbers appear as the
coefficients correcting those sums to their continuum limits. Thus the same Euler–Maclaurin
mechanism governs both the analytic continuation of (cid:80) f (k) and the convergence of Tr(T n) for
smooth kernels.

Remark 3.6 (Key picture). Finite matrices ⇒ integral kernels ⇒ Fredholm determinants—this
is the analytic bridge from combinatorial algebra to spectral analysis. In the next section, this
bridge will take a trigonometric form through the selector kernel, which connects the analytic
Stirling kernel of Section 2 to the sine kernel of random–matrix theory.

4 Selector Kernels and Periodicization

The transition from the analytic Stirling kernel of Section 2 to the trigonometric kernels of
spectral analysis is achieved by a periodic substitution. This step transforms an exponentially
generated structure into an oscillatory one, closing the bridge between combinatorial and spectral
formalisms.

4.1 Exponent–to–angle correspondence

Recall the substitution introduced in (2.3),

ez − 1 = 2i eiθ/2 sin

θ
2

,

θ ∈ [−π, π].

6

Under this mapping, the contour integral of the analytic Stirling kernel becomes a Fourier–type
integral on the circle. The exponential weight (ez − 1)t translates to a trigonometric oscillation
[sin( θ
2 )]t, and the variables (s, t) acquire a spectral interpretation: s acts as a differentiation order
and t as a mode number.

z (cid:55)→ iθ (complex contour → unit circle)

Figure 6: Exponent–to–angle substitution: periodicizing the analytic Stirling kernel.

This mapping effectively “wraps” the analytic kernel around the unit circle, producing periodic
boundary conditions and thereby embedding the combinatorial kernel into a Hilbert space of
2π–periodic functions. In this picture, discrete differences correspond to angular modes, and the
natural integral operator acts on L2[−π, π].

4.2 Definition of the selector kernel

Let J ∈ N. The selector kernel is the finite–rank operator on L2[−π, π] defined by

SJ (θ, φ) =

1
J

J−1
(cid:88)

m=0

e i(2m+1) θ−φ

2 =

sin(J θ−φ
2 )
J sin( θ−φ
2 )

cos

θ − φ
2

.

(4.1)

It acts as a projector onto the subspace spanned by the odd Fourier modes {e i(2m+1)θ/2}J−1
m=0.
The kernel SJ thus selects a discrete band of 2J trigonometric modes centered around 0.

Example 4.1 (Small J cases). For J = 1, S1(θ, φ) = cos θ−φ

2 ; for J = 2,

S2(θ, φ) = 1
2

(cid:0)ei(θ−φ)/2 + e3i(θ−φ)/2(cid:1) = cos(θ − φ) cos θ−φ
2 .

In general, SJ oscillates with period 4π/J and becomes sharply peaked at θ = φ as J increases.

4.3 Kernel normalization and properties

The normalization by 1/J in (4.1) ensures that

(cid:90) π

−π

SJ (θ, φ) SJ (φ, ψ)

dφ
2π

= SJ (θ, ψ),

so that SJ is an orthogonal projector: S 2

J = SJ . Moreover,

Tr(SJ ) =

(cid:90) π

−π

SJ (θ, θ)

dθ
2π

= 1.

These properties identify SJ as a finite–rank selector in the sense of spectral truncation.

4.4 Connection with the Stirling kernel

Through the exponential–angle substitution (2.3), the integrand of the analytic Stirling ker-
nel (2.2) acquires the same trigonometric structure as SJ in (4.1). Formally,

S(s, t) ∝

(cid:90) π

−π

[sin( θ
[sin( θ

2 )]t
2 )]s+1

e i(s−t)θ/2 dθ,

which exhibits the same sin( θ
2 ) dependence as the numerator and denominator of SJ . The
selector kernel can thus be interpreted as a periodicized Stirling kernel with discrete indices
s, t ∈ {0, . . . , J − 1}.

4.5 Periodic boundary conditions and physical meaning

Periodicization has a physical analogue. For an operator L = −d2/dx2 on (0, 1), Dirichlet
boundary conditions yield eigenvalues (nπ)2, producing determinants proportional to sin
λ.
If the interval is wrapped into a circle, periodic boundary conditions yield trigonometric kernels
whose continuum limit is the sine kernel

√

Ksine(θ, φ) =

sin(cid:0)J(θ − φ)/2(cid:1)
2π sin(cid:0)(θ − φ)/2(cid:1) .

The selector kernel (4.1) therefore plays the role of a finite–rank discretization of Ksine, bridging
the combinatorial and random–matrix frameworks[2, 3].

ζ–Regularized Determinants and Painlevé Structures

Having established the selector kernel as the finite–rank analogue of the sine kernel, we now
turn to its determinant and its connection to ζ–regularization. This section explains how spec-

8

tral products are analytically continued, and how their logarithmic derivatives satisfy nonlinear
differential equations of Painlevé type.

5.1 From eigenvalue products to ζ–determinants

For a positive self–adjoint operator L with discrete eigenvalues {λn}, define the spectral ζ–
function

ζL(s) =

(cid:88)

λ−s
n .

(5.1)

Analytic continuation of ζL(s) to s = 0 allows one to define the ζ–regularized determinant

n≥1

Detζ L = exp(cid:2)−ζ ′

L(0)(cid:3) =

(cid:89)

n≥1

λn

(regularized product).

(5.2)

This construction transforms divergent eigenvalue products into well–defined analytic quantities.
The method was introduced by Ray and Singer, and popularized in physics through the Gelfand–
Yaglom approach[1].

Remark 5.1 (Comparison). For finite rank T , the Fredholm determinant detF (I + λT ) of (3.2)
(cid:0)I − λL−1(cid:1)
is an entire function of λ. When T = L−1 for an elliptic differential operator L, detF
and Detζ(L − λ) coincide up to a normalization factor. The two formalisms therefore describe
the same analytic structure from complementary viewpoints.

5.2 Example: Dirichlet Laplacian on (0, 1)

Let L = −d2/dx2 on (0, 1) with Dirichlet–Dirichlet boundary conditions.
λn = (nπ)2, so that

Its eigenvalues are

Using the known value ζ ′(0) = − 1

,

x, y ∈ (−1, 1),

Tracy and Widom[2] showed that the corresponding Fredholm determinant

D(s) = det(I − Ks)

satisfies a nonlinear ordinary differential equation of Painlevé V type. Defining the auxiliary
function

q(s) = −

one obtains

5.4 Discrete approximation via selector kernels

For finite J, define

DJ (λ) = det(cid:0)I − λ SJ

(cid:1),

with SJ as in (4.1). As J → ∞, SJ converges weakly to the sine kernel Ks with s ≃ J/2. Hence
DJ (λ) provides a finite–dimensional approximation to D(s). Expanding log DJ (λ) in powers
of 1/J yields coefficients that again involve ζ(2m), reproducing the Bernoulli pattern seen in
log(sin x/x). Symbolically,

This asymptotic continuity between DJ and D(s) demonstrates how the selector kernel inherits
the same Painlevé V hierarchy in the large–J limit.

Remark 5.2 (Bridge completed). The analytic bridge may now be summarized as follows:

a coherent path from Bernoulli combinatorics to integrable spectral dynamics.

6 Asymptotics: Bernoulli–ζ Correspondence

The Bernoulli numbers reappear in the asymptotic behaviour of ζ–regularized and Fredholm
determinants. Their coefficients capture local geometric corrections near the diagonal of a kernel,
while the global normalization constants are governed by the values of the Riemann ζ–function
at negative integers. This section makes that correspondence explicit.

6.1 Small–s expansion: local Bernoulli structure

Hence the same even–ζ values—and therefore the same Bernoulli numbers through ζ(2m) =

spectral asymptotics.

so that the Bernoulli sequence (B2, B4, B6, . . .) directly controls the determinant expansion near

The coefficients cm of log D(s) therefore play the role of analytic Bernoulli coefficients in the
continuum setting. They encode the curvature of the logarithmic spectrum at small s, serving
as a bridge between discrete combinatorial corrections and continuous spectral geometry.

Remark 6.2 (Universality). The appearance of even–ζ values and of ζ ′(−1) is universal across
a wide range of integrable determinants: Airy and Bessel kernels (Painlevé II and III) exhibit

12

the same Bernoulli–ζ hierarchy. This universality suggests that the Bernoulli pattern encodes a
canonical asymptotic geometry underlying all ζ–regularized Fredholm systems.

7 Outlook and Generalizations

The constructions developed above suggest that the interplay between Bernoulli numbers, ζ–
regularization, and Fredholm determinants is not accidental but the manifestation of a deeper
analytic symmetry. We close this note by outlining a few directions in which the present bridge
may naturally extend.

7.1 Analytic Bernoulli functions

A natural continuum counterpart of the discrete Bernoulli numbers is the analytic Bernoulli
function

B(s; x) := −s ζ(1 − s, x),

where ζ(s, x) denotes the Hurwitz zeta function[6]. For integer s = n ∈ N, B(s; x) = Bn(x)
recovers the ordinary Bernoulli polynomial, while for complex s the function B(s; x) interpolates
smoothly between orders. Under Fourier expansion one finds

B(s; x) =

Γ(s + 1)
(2π)s

(cid:88)

n̸=0

e2πinx
(2πin)s ,

which already resembles the Fourier structure of the selector kernel. Replacing integer indices
by a continuous spectral parameter thus opens a path to a fully analytic Fredholm formalism
driven by B(s; x).

Remark 7.1 (Analytic continuation of selectors). The trigonometric selector kernel SJ (θ, φ)
can be formally viewed as the restriction of a continuous family S(s; θ, φ) obtained by replacing
the integer index J with a complex variable s. The analytic Bernoulli function B(s; x) provides
the natural generating object for such a continuation.

7.2 Umbral operators and Appell–Hermite systems

The connection between Bernoulli and Hermite structures can be made explicit by introducing
an umbral operator F ∗ that acts as a transform between Appell families:

F ∗ : Bn(x) (cid:55)−→ Hn(x),

dx Bn(x) = nBn−1(x) maps to the quantum–harmonic relation d

where Hn(x) are the Hermite polynomials. Under this correspondence, the differential recur-
rence d
dx Hn(x) = 2nHn−1(x).
The operator F ∗ therefore provides an analytic continuation from Bernoulli combinatorics to
Gaussian–Hermite spectral theory. Such umbral translations may encode the same Painlevé–
Fredholm hierarchies in a more algebraic form.

7.3 Resurgent and spectral extensions

Beyond the polynomial regime, one can pursue a resurgent extension in which ζ–regularized deter-
minants and Painlevé τ –functions are regarded as resurgent trans–series[4, 5]. The Bernoulli co-

13

efficients then appear as Stokes data governing the connection problem between different asymp-
totic sectors. This viewpoint naturally relates the present framework to the Écalle resurgence
program and to the exact WKB analysis of Schrödinger operators with analytic potentials.

7.4 Numerical and computational perspectives

On the computational side, the selector kernels SJ (θ, φ) provide a convenient laboratory for
testing ζ–regularized spectral sums. Their determinants can be evaluated numerically with high
precision and compared with the asymptotic series involving ζ(2m) and ζ ′(−1). Such comparisons
may yield efficient regularization techniques for finite–rank approximants of integrable kernels
and could be extended to other classes (Airy, Bessel, or sinh kernels).

7.5 Closing remarks

The Fredholm–Bernoulli correspondence offers a unified analytic language for discrete combina-
torics, spectral determinants, and integrable hierarchies. Its simplicity lies in the observation
that every regularization is an analytic continuation. Through this lens, the Bernoulli numbers
serve as infinitesimal regulators, the ζ–function provides their global extension, and the Fredholm
determinant acts as the functional envelope that binds them into a single analytic geometry.

From the arithmetic of Bn to the analysis of ζ(s) to the geometry of Fredholm determinants,
the same continuation principle governs all.

This note has aimed to outline the skeleton of that principle. Its details—umbral translations,
analytic Bernoulli functions, and resurgent completions—will be developed in subsequent works
of the hoge & fuga series.
