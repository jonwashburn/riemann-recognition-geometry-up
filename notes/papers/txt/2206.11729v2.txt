HALF-ISOLATED ZEROS AND ZERO-DENSITY ESTIMATES

JAMES MAYNARD AND KYLE PRATT

Abstract. We introduce a new method to detect the zeros of the Riemann zeta function
which is sensitive to the vertical distribution of the zeros. This allows us to prove there
are few ‘half-isolated’ zeros. By combining this with classical methods, we improve the
Ingham-Huxley zero-density estimate under the assumption that the non-trivial zeros of the
zeta function are restricted to lie on a ﬁnite number of ﬁxed vertical lines. This has new
consequences for primes in short intervals under the same assumption.

1. Introduction

The Riemann Hypothesis is the claim that all of the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta
function ζ(s) have real part equal to 1
2, and this would have important consequences for the
distribution of prime numbers. One consequence would be an asymptotic formula for primes
in short intervals; for any function f (x)
, we could obtain an asymptotic formula for
the number of primes in the interval [x, x + f (x)√x(log x)] under the assumption of the
Riemann Hypothesis.

For many of these applications to the distribution of primes, one can still obtain results of
2, provided these

a similar strength even if there are some zeros with real part larger than 1
exceptions are suﬃciently rare. If we deﬁne the counting function

σ)+o(1) would imply an asymptotic formula for
Hypothesis’ which claims N(σ, T )
primes in the interval [x, x + x1/2+o(1)], which is almost as strong as the result obtained under
the Riemann Hypothesis.

Although the Density Hypothesis remains unproven, weaker results in this direction can

and so as consequence one has an asymptotic formula for the number of primes in an interval
[x, x + x7/12+o(1)]. This remains essentially the best asymptotic result on primes in short
intervals to date (Heath-Brown [12] reﬁned the o(1) term via sieve methods). We note that
any improvement to the exponent in (3) in the neighbourhood of σ = 3/4 would yield a

stronger result. Various authors have improved estimates when σ > 3/4, but improving zero
density estimates for σ
3/4 remains a large open problem in analytic number theory which
has seen essentially no progress in the 80 years since Ingham’s estimate (beyond reﬁnements
to the o(1) term).

Even if one cannot improve upon (3), one might hope to obtain an improved estimate for
primes in short intervals by considering the vertical distribution of zeros close to the line
Re(s) = 3/4. If one could show suitable cancellation in sums similar to

then one could show that we obtain an asymptotic formula for primes in the interval

would exhibit essentially no cancellation. For example, for T = x5/12+δ one would need to
rule out the possibility that there are T 3/5 zeros in the set

Thus vertical arithmetic progressions of zeros present obstacles to progress on results about
primes.

Our ﬁrst main result allows us to improve on these zero density results, if we assume some
rigidity in the real parts of the zeros of ζ(s). We therefore introduce the following hypothesis.

One should be able to relax Hypothesis

considerably and still obtain similar results via
our method. For example, we could allow for zeros with ordinate in [T, 2T ], say, to lie on
(log T )/(log log T )2 well-spaced vertical lines. We have chosen to just present the simplest
≪
case in the interest of clarity. However, at our current state of knowledge it appears that
some assumption of rigidity of real parts in necessary - see Section 8 for a discussion of this.
Underlying Theorem 1 is a new unconditional way of detecting certain ‘half-isolated’ zeros
of ζ(s). The key point is that this method is sensitive to the vertical distribution of zeros.
The precise deﬁnition of a half-isolated zero is somewhat technical (see Deﬁnition 9 below),
but roughly speaking ρ0 = β0 + iγ0 is half-isolated if all nearby zeros have real part very
close to β0 and imaginary part at least γ0 (so these zeros lie vertically ‘above’ ρ0). We prove,
unconditionally, that half-isolated zeros have very short zero-detecting polynomials.

Theorem 4 (Half-isolated zeros have short zero-detecting polynomials). There exists an
1 and a ﬁxed non-negative smooth function w0 supported in [1/2, 2]
absolute constant C
such that the following holds.

If ρ0 = β0 + iγ0 is a half-isolated zero (see Deﬁnition 9 for the precise statement) with

Since short Dirichlet polynomials rarely take large values, one immediate consequence of
the existence of short zero-detecting polynomials for half-isolated zeros is that there are few
half-isolated zeros.

Similar results on eﬃciently detecting certain zeros of ζ(s) have been obtained in earlier
work of Heath-Brown (unpublished), Balasubramanian and Ramachandra [1], and Conrey
and Iwaniec [5]. The key distinguishing feature of our work is that we can detect zeros even
when there are many other zeros nearby, and this allows us to address possible obstructions
such as vertical arithmetic progressions of zeros.

We hope that the ideas underlying this estimate might evenually be extended to give an
improvement to the Huxley-Ingham bound (3). Unfortunately we have been unable, thus far,
to exploit half-isolated zeros to unconditionally provide improvements to bounds for N(σ, T );
see Section 8 for a discussion of what we perceive to be the key obstacles to obtaining an
unconditional version of Theorem 1.

Lastly, we mention a more speculative result. One may hypothesize about the vertical
distribution of the zeros when Hypothesis
occurs. Since the zeros are constrained to
F
vertical lines, and any vertical line with real part larger than 1/2 must have relatively few
zeros (by the Ingham-Huxley bounds), we see that the zeros must occur in separate ‘clusters’
of nearby zeros (where a zero of height T is ‘nearby’ another if it is within (log T )3, say, of the
other zero.) One might naively expect that if the zeros were somehow randomly distributed
on the vertical lines, then any cluster of zeros would have to be quite short. If this is indeed
the case, then we obtain stronger information on moments of the Riemann zeta function.

We leave the proof of Theorem 6 to an appendix since it has a slightly diﬀerent ﬂavour

from the rest of our paper.

2. Outline

2.1. Zero detecting polynomials. The methods of Ingham and Huxley are based on show-
ing that if ρ is a zero of ζ(s), then there must be a Dirichlet polynomial which takes a large
value at ρ; one then shows that these Dirichlet polynomials rarely take large values. The
proof of the existence of the zero-detecting polynomial does not give much control over the
length of the Dirichlet polynomial produced, but the bounds for the frequency of large values
are quite sensitive to the length of the Dirichlet polynomial. The method works well if the
Dirichlet polynomial has a convenient length, but the current estimates are limited by large
value estimates for Dirichlet polynomials of inconvenient length (for σ = 3/4 the critical
case is Dirichlet polynomials of length T 2/5). If the Dirichlet polynomial has length T ǫ, for
example, then the number of large values on the line Re(s) = σ is O(T 2(1
σ)+ǫ+o(1)), giving
−
Density Hypothesis-strength bounds when ǫ is small.

There is another, less well-known, circle of ideas for detecting zeros of the zeta function,
going back to the above-mentioned work of Heath-Brown, Balasubramanian and Ramachan-
dra, and Conrey and Iwaniec. This is our starting point.

Choose a smooth function w with compact support, and for a parameter Y > 0 we consider

the Dirichlet polynomial

SY (s) :=

n
X

Λ(n)
ns w(n/Y ).

We use Mellin inversion to rewrite the sum as an integral involving
the line of integration and pick up contributions from the zeros of ζ. Hence

where W is the Mellin transform of w and ρ ranges over non-trivial zeros of ζ. The rapid
decay of W reduces the sum over zeros to zeros ρ which are close to s. If s = ρ0 is a zero of
ζ, then there is a large contribution W (0) from ρ = ρ0, and so we ﬁnd

If there are no other nearby zeros, then the sum above is empty and SY (s) takes a large
value at ρ0. Therefore SY (s) is a zero detecting polynomial with controlled length Y , and by
choosing Y = T ǫ we are in a favourable situation for our large-values estimates. This gives
Heath-Brown’s result that there are few ‘isolated’ zeros. The work of Balasubramanian-
Ramachandra and Conrey-Iwaniec used Tur´an power-sum estimates to show that SY (ρ0) is
large for some suitable Y provided there are few zeros in the neighbourhood of ρ0. However,

if a zero ρ0 = β0 + iγ0 has

log T zeros nearby (assuming γ0 ≈

≍

T ), then this is too many

2.2. Improved power-sum estimates. Following the above strategy, by considering the
distribution of zeros close to ρ0 one might hope to be able to choose Y to avoid the ‘inconve-
nient’ lengths which arise in the Ingham-Huxley methods and still show that SY (ρ0) is large.
Unfortunately this is not possible in general; if the zeros in the neighbourhood of ρ0 are
approximately in a vertical arithmetic progression with common diﬀerence 2πci/ log T then
SY (ρ0) is small for all choices of smooth w and Y < T 1/c
ǫ. Therefore vertical arithmetic
progressions again indicate a barrier to this approach, and this potential barrier is not ruled
out by Hypothesis

−

.

One might speculate that the only obstruction to SY (ρ0) being uniformly small in this way
is caused by the local distribution of zeros being a pertubation of a small number of vertical
arithmetic progressions. This would mean that the only obstructions to the approach are
quite rigid, and in particular half-isolated zeros would be detectable since locally there would
not be any arithmetic progressions of zeros extending below the half-isolated zero.

F

The key technical ingredient in the deduction of Theorem 4 is an improved power sum
result which can be adapted to detect half-isolated zeros. This then does allow us to deduce
that there is a choice of small Y where SY (ρ0) is large when ρ0 is half-isolated. There are
several technical assumptions in the full statement of the result, but the following special
case is indicative.

2.3. Local-global structure using Hypothesis
is that
if the zeros lie on ﬁnitely many vertical lines, then zeros come in vertical ‘clusters’, with a
half-isolated zero at the bottom of each cluster (see Deﬁnition 18 for a precise deﬁnition of
cluster, but imagine two zeros ρ, ρ′ of height T are in the same cluster if there is a sequence
(log T )3

We exploit the clustering phenomenon by averaging over zeros within a single cluster, as
well as averaging over clusters themselves. To do this successfully requires a combination of
the ﬂexible zero-detecting polynomials for half-isolated zeros, as well as the more classical
zero-detecting techniques.

Standard Tur´an power sum methods (see, for example [19, Chapter 5, Theorem 1]) would
show that there is an integer t

constant c > 0. In this case we obtain an exponential improvement in the lower bound and
a tighter bound on t by exploiting positivity of the coeﬃcients and the fact that we consider
t real. Other variants of Tur´an’s method do exploit positivity of the coeﬃcients (see [19,
Chapter 5, §6]), but we are not aware of any results which allow us to restrict the range of
t to a short interval, which is vital for our applications.

Remark 14. A version of Lemma 11 was independently shown by Jean Bourgain (private
communication to the ﬁrst author), with essentially the same proof. Will Sawin [21] also
independently proved a version of Lemma 11, again with fundamentally the same proof. It
seems plausible a version of this lemma has existed in the literature for some time; Terence
Tao pointed out to us that this can be viewed as a consequence of a quantiﬁed version of
the F. and M. Riesz Theorem.

In this section we introduce the key results we need to prove Theorem 1. We begin with
some notation and deﬁnitions. The ﬁrst deﬁnition is the notion of Type I zeros in the theory
of density estimates.

We say that ρ is ‘detected by a Dirichlet polynomial of length N’, if

We remark that the zeros in a cluster are taken without multiplicity. Indeed, the multi-

plicity of zeros has no import in our arguments, since the bound N(T + 1)
means multiplicities only contribute harmless logarithmic factors.

8. Obstructions

We hope that the ideas we have introduced in this paper can lead to new and improved
zero-density estimates. However, as alluded to in the introduction, there are potential ob-
structions one must rule out in order to have a chance of making our results unconditional.
We call these potential bad conﬁgurations “bows” of zeros.

A bow of zeros is a set of zeros where the imaginary parts lie in an arithmetic progression
1
log T , and where the real parts of the zeros vary smoothly between
T ǫ of

with common diﬀerence

Figure 2. A bow of zeros, marked by crosses

Locally (at a scale T o(1)) every zero (except for the few zeros near the ends of the bow)
looks like a zero in the middle of a vertical arithmetic progression, since the real parts are
almost constant at this scale. Therefore it seems impossible to make the “local” power

HALF-ISOLATED ZEROS AND ZERO-DENSITY ESTIMATES

27

sum-type arguments of Section 4 work, since a variation of Remark 13 (3) using Poisson
summation would show that the corresponding sum over zeros would be uniformly small
when trying to detect any zero in the middle of a bow.
On the other hand, since the bow is based on the 1

2-line and only has length T ǫ, it does
not seem possible to use “global” clustering arguments to advantage either. Finding a short
zero detector of a zero at the end of the bow would be of no use, since the zero would lie
on the 1
2 line and so would not correspond to an unusually large value of the zero detecting
polynomial. Since the length of the cluster is only of length T ǫ, we could only hope to
improve bounds by T O(ǫ), which would be negligible as ǫ
0. Therefore none of the new
→
ideas in this paper appear to help with detecting these bows.

Finally, classical zero detecting arguments appear to oﬀer no help in detecting bows of
zeros. It appears entirely consistent with the Ingham-Huxley density estimate (3) (and the
underlying methods) that there are ' T 3/5 bows of zeros (22) at height T0 ≍
If the
vertical gaps between zeros were signiﬁcantly smaller than the average gap, then one might
hope to use zero-repulsion techniques to rule out the possibility of there being so many nearby
zeros away from the 1
2-line, but this argument appears break down unless c is suﬃciently
small. When the clusters have small length, quantities such as N ∗(σ, T ) from [10, 11] which
estimate the approximate additive energy also appear to be of no help.

T .

For these reasons the rigidity on the real parts of zeros imposed by Hypothesis

seems
diﬃcult to dispense with. If one could show that the only conﬁgurations of points where the
corresponding sums are uniformly small come from a small number of vertical arithmetic
progressions, then detecting bows of zeros would be essentially the only obstacle to an
unconditional result.

F

Remark 36. The conﬁguration of “bows” of zeros has some similarities to problematic con-
ﬁgurations of zeros which obstruct improvements to the least quadratic non-residue (see [6,
Appendix]). We thank Roger Heath-Brown for pointing this out to us.

Appendix A. The fifth moment of the zeta function

For the convenience of the reader we restate Theorem 6 as the following proposition.

Proposition 37. Suppose that all of the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function lie
on ﬁnitely many vertical lines. Suppose further that on each vertical line with real part > 1
2
the zeros only occur in clusters of size

We now consider the terms with n1 ≤

T 1/2+o(1) we think of n2 as being
somewhat large. By factoring n2 we introduce sums over primes, and by Mellin inversion we
turn the sums over primes into sums over zeros. This transforms the moment integral into
an integral centred on non-trivial zeros. We then use Hypothesis
and short zero-detecting
polynomials to control the integral centred on zeros by sums which can be handled with
Watt’s mean value theorem.

Proof. By Hypothesis
the non-trivial zeros lie on ﬁnitely many vertical lines, and so it
suﬃces to consider each of the possibilities for Re(ρ) separately. Moreover, since we assume
T ε0 zeros, every zero with real part β0 is within O(T ε0+o(1))
that all zeros lie in a cluster of
of a half-isolated zero with real part β0. Upon redeﬁning ǫ, it suﬃces to show that for any
