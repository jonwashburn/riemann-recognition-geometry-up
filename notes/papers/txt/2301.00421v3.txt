ON THE HILBERT SPACE DERIVED FROM
THE WEIL DISTRIBUTION

MASATOSHI SUZUKI

Abstract. We study the Hilbert space obtained by completing the space of all smooth
and compactly supported functions on the real line with respect to the hermitian form
arising from the Weil distribution under the Riemann hypothesis. It turns out that
this Hilbert space is isomorphic to a de Branges space by a composition of the Fourier
transform and a simple map. This result is applied to state new equivalence conditions
for the Riemann hypothesis in a series of equalities.

1. Introduction

The Weil distribution is a distribution associated with the Riemann zeta-function

ζ(s). Let

ξ(s) =

1
2

s(s − 1)π−s/2Γ

(cid:17)

(cid:16) s
2

ζ(s)

be the Riemann xi-function, where Γ(s) is the gamma-function. Let Γ be the set of all
zeros of ξ(1/2 − iz) without multiplicity and let mγ denote the multiplicity of γ ∈ Γ.
The Riemann hypothesis (RH, for short) claims that all nontrivial zeros of ζ(s) lie on
the critical line ℜ(s) = 1/2. It is equivalent to the assertion that all γ ∈ Γ are real.

The Weil distribution is the linear functional W : C∞

C∞

c (R) ∋ ψ (cid:55)→ W (ψ) :=

(cid:88)

γ∈Γ

c (R) → C defined by
mγ (cid:98)ψ(−γ),

where C∞

c (R), since we

RH is true if and only if the Weil distribution W is nonnegative definite, that is,

W (ψ ∗ (cid:101)ψ) ≥ 0

for every ψ ∈ C∞

c (R),

where

(ϕ ∗ ψ)(x) :=

(cid:90) ∞

−∞

ϕ(y)ψ(x − y) dy

and

(cid:101)ψ(x) := ψ(−x).

Further, if the RH is true, the Weil distribution is positive definite, that is, W (ψ ∗ (cid:101)ψ) > 0
for every nonzero ψ ∈ C∞

c (R).

Using the Weil distribution, we define the hermitian form ⟨·, ·⟩W on C∞

c (R) by

⟨ψ1, ψ2⟩W = W (ψ1 ∗ (cid:102)ψ2) =

(cid:88)

for complex-valued functions of a complex variable. We often use this ♯ notation. We
call this hermitian form the Weil hermitian form. Yoshida [19] has studied the Weil
hermitian form in detail by restricting it to a function space on a finite interval [−a, a]
(a > 0). The subject of the present article is the behavior of the Weil hermitian form on
the whole line R. Yoshida proposed a method to complete a function space on a finite
interval with respect to the Weil hermitian form without assuming the RH, but it does
not extend to the whole line.

c (R). Therefore, the completion HW of the pre-Hilbert space C∞

Suppose that the RH is true. Then the Weil hermitian form ⟨·, ·⟩W is positive definite
c (R) with respect
on C∞
to ⟨·, ·⟩W is defined. The first main result is an explicit description of the Hilbert space
HW . The elements of HW are equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences with respect
to ⟨·, ·⟩W , where two Cauchy sequences are equivalent if their difference converges to
zero with respect to ⟨·, ·⟩W . The representative of each class can be chosen from L2(R)
(Theorem 5.5 below). Such a result is expected from Lemmas 2 and 3 in [19]. Therefore,
we denote the class represented by ψ ∈ L2(R) as [ψ] and often identify ψ with [ψ].

For the concrete description of HW , we use a de Branges space and a model space.

The entire function Eξ defined by

Eξ(z) := ξ(1/2 − iz) + ξ′(1/2 − iz)
belongs to the Hermite–Biehler class under the RH [8, Theorem 1] and hence it defines
the de Branges space H(Eξ), where the dash on the right-hand side of (1.3) means
differentiation of ξ(s) with respect to s. Furthermore, the meromorphic function

(1.3)

Θξ(z) := E♯

(1.4)
in C is a meromorphic inner function in the upper-half plane C+ = {z | ℑ(z) > 0} under
the RH, and therefore it defines the model space K(Θξ). These two Hilbert spaces
H(Eξ) and K(Θξ) are isomorphic with ∥EξF ∥H(Eξ) = ∥F ∥K(Θξ) for every F ∈ K(Θξ)
(see Section 2 for details on the Hermite–Biehler class, de Branges spaces, and model
spaces). Then the first result is stated as follows.

ξ(z)/Eξ(z)

Theorem 1.1. Assume that the RH holds. Let HW , H(Eξ), and K(Θξ) be Hilbert spaces
as above. Then, the map K(Θξ) → HW defined by

F (cid:55)→ [ψF ], ψF := F−1(F )

is an isomorphism between Hilbert spaces and satisfies
H(Eξ) = ∥F ∥2

∥EξF ∥2

K(Θξ) = π⟨ψF , ψF ⟩W = π⟨[ψF ], [ψF ]⟩W

for F ∈ K(Θξ), where F−1 is the Fourier inversion on L2(R).

This result is proved in Section 5. Note that Theorem1.1 provides an isomorphism as
a Hilbert space, not as a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The space HW is a space of
equivalence classes of functions, not a space of functions.

Lagarias suggested after Theorem 1 of [8] that the norm of the de Branges space
H(Eξ) and the Weil hermitian form (the spectral side of the “explicit formula” of prime
number theory) are similar. Theorem 1.1 shows that they are naturally coincident.
Hence, HW and H(Eξ) must have an “arithmetic structure” through the Weil explicit
formula (3.3) below, but we will not discuss this further.

Connes, Consani, and Moscovici [4, Section 4.8] also describe the relation between the
theory of de Branges spaces and the Weil hermitian form, but their de Branges spaces BS
λ
and H(Eξ) have completely different properties. Due to the difference in the generators
of the de Branges spaces, they are not isomorphic, and a more obvious difference is that
they have different spectral properties (see the second half of Section 6).

One of the remarkable properties of de Branges spaces is the structure of subspaces.
The set of all de Branges subspaces of a given de Branges space is totally ordered by

ON THE HILBERT SPACE DERIVED FROM THE WEIL DISTRIBUTION

set-theoretical inclusion (see [18, pp. 500–506] for details). Such a structure also comes
to HW through the isomorphism of Theorem 1.1 as stated in Theorem 5.7 below.

Another notable property of de Branges spaces is the explicit description of the fam-
ily of self-adjoint extensions of the multiplication operator by an independent variable
F (z) (cid:55)→ zF (z). It enables us to interpret the set of zeros Γ as the set of eigenvalues of
a self-adjoint operator on HW . This means that one of the Hilbert–P´olya spaces is the
Hilbert space HW naturally obtained from the Weil distribution (see Sections 2.3 and 6
for details).

As stated in Theorem 1.1, the Hilbert space HW is isomorphic to a de Branges
space under the RH. Moreover, representatives of classes in HW can be chosen from the
concrete subspace V (0) of L2(R) defined in (5.2) below. It is surprising that such an
explicit description of HW is possible, and interesting in itself. However, it is a matter of
concern that it is not even possible to define HW , H(Eξ), and K(Θξ) without assuming
the RH. Fortunately, by considering a screw line of the screw function attached to ζ(s),
which will be explained in Sections 2.1 and 4.2, we can unconditionally construct two
special Hilbert spaces H0 and K0 (in Section 3.3) to be isomorphic to HW and K(Θξ),
respectively, under the RH (Theorem 5.6). The construction of such spaces leads to an
equivalence condition for the RH stated below. That is the second main result.

In Selberg’s answer to the second question in [1, p. 632], he states that the construc-
tion of a space assuming the RH will not be useful for attacking the RH. However, H0
and K0 may be useful in future research on the RH, since they are defined without the
RH.

Let L2(R) be the usual L2-space on the real line with respect to the Lebesgue measure.

We define

is the Hurwitz–Lerch zeta-function. For negative t, we set St(z) := S−t(z). The
definition of Pt(z) is quite complicated. However, using the set Γ of zeros of ξ(1/2 − iz),
it can be expressed in the simple form (3.2) (see Proposition 3.1 below). Nevertheless,
as a tool for stating an equivalent condition for the RH, it seems preferable to have a
representation that does not involve Γ. Thus, here we adopt a version of (3.2) rewritten
without Γ using Weil’s explicit formula (3.3). In Weil’s explicit formula, the first, second,
and the third-fourth lines on the right-hand side of (1.6) correspond to the poles of the
completed zeta-function π−s/2Γ(s/2)ζ(s), the non-archimedean part (Euler product),
and the archimedean part (gamma factor), respectively.

For this St, we first obtain the following.

M. SUZUKI

Proposition 1.2. For any fixed t ∈ R, St(z) belongs to L2(R) as a function of z.

Proof. See Section 3.2.

□

From this result, the mapping t (cid:55)→ St(z) from R to L2(R) is defined. By the unifor-
mity of the L2-norm of St(z) on a compact set of t obtained in the proof of Proposition
1.2 and Minkowski’s integral inequality, the following holds.

Proposition 1.3. For ϕ ∈ C∞

using (1.5). Then (cid:99)Pϕ(z) belongs to L2(R).

Using the image of the composition (cid:99)PD := (cid:98)P ◦ D of the integral operator (cid:98)P and the

differential operator

(Dψ)(t) := iψ′(t),

(1.8)

we obtain the following equivalence condition for the RH.

Theorem 1.4. The RH is true if and only if the equality

holds for all ψ ∈ C∞
(1.9) holds for countably many choices of ψ’s, then the RH follows.

c (R). Furthermore, by choosing the test functions appropriately, if

L2(R) = π⟨ψ, ψ⟩W

∥ (cid:100)PDψ∥2

Proof. See Section 4.3.

Equation (1.9) is reformulated to the following simpler form.

Corollary 1.5. Define the subspace V ◦(0) of L2(R) by

(cid:12) ψ ∈ C∞
(cid:12)

(cid:110)
F−1 (cid:100)PDψ

V ◦(0) :=

(cid:111)
.

Then the RH is true if and only if the equality

2∥ψ∥2

L2(R) = ⟨ψ, ψ⟩W

holds for all ψ ∈ V ◦(0).

Proof. See Section 4.3 and Theorem 5.6.

□

(1.10)

□

The advantage of Theorem 1.4 and Corollary 1.5 is that it has turned the criterion
It
of the RH from a set of inequalities like Weil’s criterion into a set of equalities.
should also be noted that equations (1.9) and (1.10) can be expressed without zeros of
ξ(1/2 − iz) by (1.5) and (1.6). Furthermore, equations (1.9) and (1.10) claim that the
nonnegativity of Weil’s hermitian form is explained by the nonnegativity of the L2-norm.

In the following sections, first, in Section 2, we briefly review necessary notions such
as screw functions, screw lines, the Hermite–Biehler class, de Branges spaces, and model
spaces. Then, in Section 3, we state and prove unconditional results that we need to
prove the main results. Moreover, we unconditionally define two Hilbert spaces H0 and
K0 that agree with the Hilbert spaces HW and K(Θ), respectively, under the RH.

In Section 4, we show that St(z) in (1.5) gives a screw line of the screw function
corresponding to the Riemann zeta-function under the RH (Theorem 4.2). Furthermore,
we prove Theorem 1.4 and Corollary 1.5. The strategy of the proof of Theorem 4.2 is
basically the same as that of [15, Theorem 1.1], with Proposition 4.1 playing an essential
role in both cases. To carry this out, the rewriting of (1.5) into (3.6), prepared in
Section 3 using Weil’s explicit formula, corresponds to the transformation from (1.7) to
(3.6) in [15], although the technical details of the calculations differ considerably. On
the other hand, the analytic or geometric meaning of the functions giving the norms was

ON THE HILBERT SPACE DERIVED FROM THE WEIL DISTRIBUTION

unclear in [15], whereas in the present article, these functions have a clear interpretation
as a screw line. Furthermore, as an advantage of employing the screw line St(z), we
obtain Theorem 1.4, for which no analog was obtained in [15].

In Section 5, we prove Theorem 1.1 in a more detailed form. In addition, we prove
that H0 = HW and K0 = K(Θξ) under the RH. Afterward, we explain that the Hilbert
space HW is one of the Hilbert–P´olya spaces in Section 6. Finally, we mention two
special values of St(z) in Section 7 as an appendix.

2. Review on necessary notions

2.1. Screw functions and screw lines. In this and the next part, we refer to [7,
Sections 5 and 12]. See also its references for details. Following Kre˘ın, we denote by G∞
the space of all continuous functions g(t) on R such that g(−t) = g(t) and the kernel

Gg(t, u) := g(t − u) − g(t) − g(−u) + g(0)

(2.1)

is nonnegative definite on R, that is, (cid:80)n
ξi ∈ C (i = 1, 2, ..., n). Functions belonging to G∞ are called screw functions on R.

i,j=1 Gg(ti, tj) ξiξj ≥ 0 for all n ∈ N, ti ∈ R, and

If an (even) real-valued function g(t) is a screw function, then there exists a Hilbert

space H and a continuous mapping t (cid:55)→ x(t) from R into H such that

⟨x(t + v) − x(v), x(u + v) − x(v)⟩H
is independent of v ∈ R for all t, u ∈ R and the equality ⟨x(t) − x(0), x(u) − x(0)⟩H =
H = −2g(t) if g(0) = 0. A mapping x : R → H
Gg(t, u) holds. Therefore, ∥x(t) − x(0)∥2
endowed with the translation-invariance described above is called a screw line for g(t).

2.2. Hilbert spaces associated with screw functions. Each g ∈ G∞ defines a non-
negative definite hermitian form on R by

⟨ϕ1, ϕ2⟩Gg :=

(cid:90) ∞

(cid:90) ∞

−∞

−∞

Gg(t, u)ϕ1(u)ϕ2(t) dudt.

(2.2)

According to [7, Section 5], we denote by L(Gg) the space C0(R) of all continuous and
compactly supported functions ϕ on R such that (cid:98)ϕ(0) = 0 equipped with the hermitian
inner product ⟨·, ·⟩Gg . We also denote by H(Gg) the completion of the factor space
L(Gg)/L◦(Gg), where L◦(Gg) = {ϕ ∈ L(Gg) | ⟨ϕ, ϕ⟩Gg = 0}. Note that even if ⟨·, ·⟩Gg is
positive definite on L(Gg), that is, L◦(Gg) = {0}, there possibly exists a sequence (ϕn)n
of L(Gg) such that ϕn → 0 as n → ∞ with respect to ⟨·, ·⟩Gg . The completion H(Gg) is
a space of equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences with respect to ⟨·, ·⟩Gg . Two Cauchy
sequences are equivalent if their difference converges to zero with respect to ⟨·, ·⟩Gg . We
denote by [ϕ] ∈ H(Gg) the equivalence class represented by ϕ. In general, elements of
H(Gg) are not necessarily represented by functions unlike HW (cf. [7, Section 4.3]).

Every g ∈ G∞ admits a representation

establishes an isomorphism between H(Gg) and L2(τ ).

2.3. De Branges spaces. In this part, we refer to [12, 18]. See also those references for
details. Let H 2 := H 2(C+) = F(L2(0, ∞)) be the Hardy space in the upper half-plane.
As usual, we identify H 2 with a closed subspace of L2(R) via boundary values. Then,
the inner product of H 2 coincides with the standard inner product of L2(R).

The Hermite–Biehler class consists of entire functions E satisfying |E♯(z)| < |E(z)|
for all z ∈ C+. For each entire function E belonging to the Hermite–Biehler class, the
de Branges space H(E) is defined as a Hilbert space consisting of entire functions F (z)
such that both F (z)/E(z) and F ♯(z)/E(z) belong to H 2 and have the norm

∥F ∥H(E) := ∥F/E∥L2(R).
The multiplication operator M by an independent variable is defined by D(M) =
{F (z) ∈ H(E) | zF (z) ∈ H(E)} and (MF )(z) = zF (z) for F ∈ D(M). The domain
D(M) is dense in H(E) if and only if

(eiθE(z) − e−iθE♯(z))

Sθ(z) :=

(2.4)

does not belong to H(E) for all θ ∈ [0, π) [12, Theorem 11]. The particular two θ cases
are often written as A(z) := −Sπ/2(z) and B(z) := S0(z).

If D(M) is dense in H(E), all self-adjoint extensions of M are parametrized by θ ∈ [0, π)

and are described as follows. The domain of Mθ is

D(Mθ) =

(cid:26)

G(z) =

Sθ(w0)F (z) − Sθ(z)F (w0)
z − w0

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

(cid:27)

F (z) ∈ H(E)

,

(2.5)

and the operation is defined by

MθG(z) = z G(z) + F (w0)Sθ(z),
where w0 is a fixed complex number with Sθ(w0) ̸= 0 [6, Propositions 4.6 and 6.1]. The
domain D(Mθ) is independent of the choice of the number w0. For a fixed θ ∈ [0, π), we
confirm that G(z) = Sθ(z)/(z − γ) belongs to D(Mθ) by taking

(2.6)

Sθ(z)
Sθ(w0)
for every zero γ of Sθ(z) and is an eigenfunction of Mθ with the eigenvalue γ. Further,
{Sθ(z)/(z − γ) | Sθ(γ) = 0} forms an orthogonal basis of H(E) [5, Theorem 22].

γ − w0
z − γ

F (z) =

2.4. Model subspaces. In this part, we refer to [9, Section 2], [13, Section 3.5] and
[15, Section 3.1]. See also those references for details.

Let H ∞ = H ∞(C+) be the space of all bounded analytic functions in C+. A function
Θ ∈ H ∞ is called an inner function in C+ if limy→0+ |Θ(x+iy)| = 1 for almost all x ∈ R.
For an inner function Θ, a model space K(Θ) is defined as the orthogonal complement
K(Θ) = H 2 ⊖ ΘH 2 and has the alternative representation

K(Θ) = H 2 ∩ Θ ¯H 2,
(2.7)
where ΘH 2 = {Θ(z)F (z) | F ∈ H 2} and ¯H 2 = H 2(C−) is the Hardy space in the
lower half-plane. The model space K(Θ) is a subspace of L2(R) as a Hilbert space. In
particular, the inner product of K(Θ) matches that of L2(R) on the real line.

If an inner function Θ in C+ extends to a meromorphic function in C, then it is
called a meromorphic inner function in C+. For any meromorphic inner function Θ,
there exists E of the Hermite–Biehler class such that Θ = E♯/E. The de Branges
space H(E) is isometrically isomorphic to K(Θ) by F (z) (cid:55)→ E(z)F (z). In particular,
H(E) = E H 2 ∩ E♯ ¯H 2

For a meromorphic inner function Θ, let µΘ be the positive discrete measure on R

supported on σ(Θ) = {x ∈ R | Θ(x) = −1} and

µΘ(x) =

2π
|Θ′(x)|

.

(2.8)

Then the restriction map F (cid:55)→ F |σ(Θ) is an isometric operator from K(Θ) to L2(µΘ) [9,
Theorem 2.1]. The isometric property of the map implies that the family of functions

(2.9)

parametrized by all zeros γ of A(z) = −Sπ/2(z) forms an orthonormal basis of K(Θ) if
D(M) is dense in H(E).

3. Unconditional results

Throughout this and later sections, we denote E = Eξ and Θ = Θξ = E♯

ξ/Eξ for

functions defined in (1.3) and (1.4), respectively. Otherwise, it is mentioned.

3.1. Expansion of Pt(z) over the zeros. For the basic properties of the Riemann
zeta-function, we refer to [16]. By the two functional equations ξ(s) = ξ(1 − s) and
ξ(s) = ξ♯(s), if γ belongs to the set of zeros Γ, then both −γ and γ also belong to Γ
with the same multiplicity. On the other hand, |ℑ(γ)| < 1/2 for every γ ∈ Γ, since all
zeros of ξ(s) lie in the strip 0 < ℜ(s) < 1. For E(z) of (1.3), we define

A(z) := (E(z) + E♯(z))/2

(3.1)

as in Section 2.3. Then A(z) = ξ(1/2 − iz), because E♯(z) = E(¯z) = ξ(1/2 − iz) −
ξ′(1/2 − iz) by functional equations of ξ(s). Therefore, the set Γ coincides with the set
of all zeros of both A(z) and 1 + Θ(z). We define

Pt(z) :=

(cid:88)

γ∈Γ

mγ

e−iγt − 1
γ

·

z − γ

(3.2)

for nonnegative t. For negative t, we set Pt(z) := P−t(z). The series on the right-hand
side of (3.2) converges absolutely and uniformly on every compact subset of C \ Γ, since
(cid:80)
γ∈Γ mγ|γ|−1−δ < ∞ for any δ > 0, because A(z) is an entire function of order one.
Therefore, Pt(z) is a meromorphic function on C with Γ as the set of all poles.

Proposition 3.1. Let Pt(z) and Pt(z) be meromorphic functions defined by (1.6) and
(3.2), respectively. Then, both coincide.

Proof. For t ≥ 0 and z ∈ C+, we define

ϕz,t(x) =

Therefore, the left-hand side of Weil’s explicit formula for ϕz,t(x) gives Pt(z) of (3.2)
when ℑ(z) > 1/2. Hence, if it is shown that the right-hand side is equal to Pt(z) for
ℑ(z) > 1/2, then the conclusion of the proposition follows by analytic continuation.

From the calculation of the five terms on the right-hand side above, we conclude that
□
the right-hand side of the Weil explicit formula for ϕz,t(x) equals (1.6).
3.2. Proof of Proposition 1.2. We have |Θ(z)| = 1 for every z ∈ R by definition.
In fact, zeros of E(z) in the denominator cancel out in the numerator E♯(z), even if
they exist. Further, Pt(z) has poles of order one at γ ∈ Γ, but St(z) is holomorphic
there, since (1 + Θ(z))/2 = A(z)/E(z) = A(z)/(A(z) + iA′(z)) = (z − γ)(−i/mγ + o(1))
near z = γ by direct calculation. Hence, St(z) is bounded and holomorphic on the real
line by (1.5), (3.2), and Proposition 3.1. On the other hand, in the horizontal strip
|ℑ(z)| ≤ 1/2, we have the well-known estimate (Γ′/Γ)(1/4 + iz/2) ≪ log |z| and

an implied constant depending on a compact set of t by (1.6). Hence St(z) belongs to

L2(R) and the norm is uniformly bounded on a compact set of t.

Lemma 3.2. Equation (3.9) defines a norm on C∞

Proof. We obtain ∥ψ1 + ψ2∥0 ≤ ∥ψ1∥0 + ∥ψ2∥0 and ∥kψ∥0 = |k|∥ψ∥0 for ψ1, ψ2, ψ ∈
c (R) and k ∈ C by the obvious linearity of (cid:99)PD. Therefore, the proof is completed if
C∞
it is shown that ∥ψ∥0 = 0 implies ψ = 0. If ∥ψ∥0 = 0, the image (cid:100)PDψ(z) is identically
zero. The latter means that (cid:98)ψ(γ) = 0 for all γ ∈ Γ, because, if not, there must exist a
sequence (cγ)γ∈Γ such that (cid:80)
γ∈Γ cγ(z − γ)−1 is identically zero on C by (3.5) and (3.8),
but it is impossible. If (cid:98)ψ(γ) = 0 for all γ ∈ Γ, it implies that ψ is identically zero by
□
[14, Lemma 2.1].

By Lemma 3.2, we can complete the space C∞

c (R) with respect to ∥ ∥0. We denote the

completion by H0. On the other hand, we denote the L2-closure of the image (cid:99)PD(C∞

the Hermite–Biehler class [8, Theorem 1], and thus Θ = Θξ is a meromorphic inner

respectively. We need the following result for the later discussion.

Proposition 4.1. Assume that the RH is true. Then, the family (3.5) forms an or-

under the RH as stated in [14, Theorem 1.2]. One of the screw lines corresponding to
gξ(t) can be constructed as follows.

Let τξ be the nonnegative measure representing gξ(t) as in (2.3) under the RH. Then
the Hilbert space H = L2(τξ) and the mapping t (cid:55)→ x(t) := (eitγ − 1)/γ provide a screw
line satisfying ∥x(t) − x(0)∥2
H = −2gξ(t) [7, Section 12]. This spectral construction of
the screw line is important and useful in analysis, but it is of limited use for studying
the nontrivial zeros of ζ(s) without assuming the RH. In the following, we show that St
gives a screw line of gξ(t). In contrast to the spectral screw line above, this screw line
can be used to study HW , as will be done later.

Theorem 4.2. Assume the RH is true and let g(t) = gξ(t). Then, the mapping t (cid:55)→

of Γ with mγ = m−γ, we find that the right-hand side of (4.9) equals π⟨ϕ, ϕ⟩Gg .

Conversely, we prove that the RH is true assuming equality (4.8). We show that a
contradiction arises if the RH is false. We take a nonreal γ0 ∈ Γ. For any ϵ > 0, there
c (R) such that (cid:99)ψ1(−γ0) = i, (cid:99)ψ2(−γ0) = −i, |(cid:99)ψ1(−γ)| ≤ ϵ|γ0 − γ|−1−δ
exists ψ1, ψ2 ∈ C∞
for every γ ∈ Γ\{γ0}, and |(cid:99)ψ2(−γ)| ≤ ϵ|γ0 −γ|−1−δ for every γ ∈ Γ\{γ0} by [19, Lemma
1]. We define ψ := ψ1 + ψ2 (̸= 0) and set ϕ := Dψ. Then, (cid:98)ϕ(0) = 0 by definition, and
⟨ϕ, ϕ⟩Gg = ⟨ψ, ψ⟩W holds by the relation

⟨Dψ1, Dψ2⟩Gg = ⟨ψ1, ψ2⟩W

(4.10)

in [14, Proposition 3.1]. The right-hand side equals (cid:80)
O(ϵ), since (cid:80)
ϵ > 0, but it contradicts the nonnegativity that follows from (4.8).

(cid:98)ψ(z) = (cid:80)
πmγ (cid:99)ψ0(γ)Fγ(z) by (3.8). The equality shows that (cid:98)ψ(z) is a continuous
function of z ∈ R by the uniform convergence of the right-hand side on a compact
set of z. Taking z = γ in this equality, we have (cid:98)ψ(γ) = (cid:99)ψ0(γ) by (4.2). Therefore,
⟨ψ, ψ⟩W is defined and satisfies ⟨ψ, ψ⟩W = ⟨ψ0, ψ0⟩W . The right-hand side is equal to

Then, the RH holds if ⟨gn, gn⟩W ≥ 0 for all n ∈ Z>0 by Bombieri and Lagarias [2,
Section 4]. Therefore, we obtain the following.
Corollary 4.6. The RH holds if (4.11) holds for all gn (n ∈ Z>0).

5. Proof of Theorem 1.1 and its refinement

Throughout this section, we assume that the RH is true and denote E = Eξ, Θ =
Θξ = E♯
ξ/Eξ as before, and denote g = gξ. Therefore, E belongs to the Hermite–Biehler
class, Θ is a meromorphic inner function in C+, and g belongs to the class of screw
functions G∞.

For use in the proof of Theorem 1.1 and its refinement, we introduce the operator K

acting on L2(R) by

K := F−1MΘJF

(5.1)

with

(MΘF )(z) := Θ(z)F (z)

and (JF )(z) := F ♯(z).

The Fourier transform F, the multiplication operator MΘ, and the involution J are
defined for functions of a complex variable, and the latter two are isometries on L2(R).
The Fourier transform F is an isometry up to a constant factor. Therefore, K is isometric
on L2(R). Further, K is invertible by K2 = id. By definition, K is not C-linear but R-
linear and conjugate linear. Using the isometric involution K, we define

V (t) := L2(t, ∞) ∩ KL2(t, ∞)

(5.2)

and

HW (t) := { [ψ] | ψ ∈ V (t) }
for t ≥ 0. The set of subspaces V (t) of L2(R) are clearly totally ordered by the set-
theoretical inclusion.

First, Theorem 1.1 is shown using V (t) for t = 0, and it is refined using general t ≥ 0.

Lemma 5.1. Let V (0) = L2(0, ∞) ∩ KL2(0, ∞). Then, we have K(Θ) = F(V (0)), and
hence H(E) = EF(V (0)) = {E(z) (cid:98)ψ(z) | ψ ∈ V (0)}.

Proof. It is sufficient to prove that K(Θ) = F(V (0)), since H(E) = EK(Θ). The proof
below is essentially the same as the proof in [13, Lemma 4.1].

If ψ ∈ V (0), both Fψ and FKψ belong to the Hardy space H 2 by definition (5.1) and
H 2 = F(L2(0, ∞)). On the other hand, we have (FKψ)(z) = Θ(z)(Fψ)♯(z) by definition
(5.1) again. This implies (Fψ)(z) = Θ(z)(FKψ)♯(z), since Θ(z)Θ♯(z) = 1 by definition
(1.4). Therefore, Fψ belongs to K(Θ) by (2.7).

Conversely, if F ∈ K(Θ), there exists f ∈ L2(0, ∞) and g ∈ L2(−∞, 0) such that

F (z) = (Ff )(z) = Θ(z)(Fg)(z).
We have (Fg)♯(z) = Θ(z)(Ff )♯(z) by using Θ(z)Θ♯(z) = 1 again. Here (Fg)♯(z) = (F˜g)(z)
for ˜g(x) = g(−x) ∈ L2(0, ∞), and Θ(z)(Ff )♯(z) = (FKf )(z) as above. Hence Kf belongs
□
to L2(0, ∞), and thus f ∈ V (0).

Remark 5.2. By Lemma 5.1, it follows that the RH would be false if V (0) = 0, since
A(z)/(z − γ) = ξ(1/2 − iz)/(z − γ) belongs to H(E) for all γ ∈ Γ under the assumption
of the RH. Therefore, it is an interesting problem to prove or disprove V (0) ̸= 0 un-
conditionally. Since V (0) is K-invariant, if V (0) ̸= 0, then for any nonzero f ∈ V (0),
the functions (1 ± K)f are eigenfunctions of K with eigenvalues ±1. Hence, the problem
reduces to determining whether the isometric involution K admits an eigenfunction in
L2(0, ∞), which appears to be extremely difficult. We therefore do not pursue this issue
further in the present article.

For ψ ∈ V (0), the function Sψ ∈ L2(τ ) is defined and satisfies 2∥ψ∥2

geometric side of the Weil explicit formula (3.3) coincide on a dense subspace of V (0)
consisting of functions for which the Weil explicit formula holds.

Theorem 5.6. Let H0 and K0 are Hilbert spaces defined unconditionally in Section 3.3.
Assume that the RH is true. Then, H0 = HW and K0 = K(Θ), and the extended map
(cid:99)PD : HW → K(Θ) provides the inverse of the map in Theorem 5.5 (2). In particular,
V (0) is the L2-closure of V ◦(0) in Corollary 1.5.

Formula (3.8) shows that the image (cid:100)PDψ is defined independent of the representatives
of [ψ] in HW . On the other hand, K0 is a subspace of K(Θ) by Proposition 4.1 again.
We denote F = (cid:100)PDψ for [ψ] ∈ HW and set ψF = F−1(F ) as in Theorem 1.1. Then,
F (γ) = (cid:98)ψ(γ) by (3.8) and (4.2). Therefore, (cid:99)ψF (γ) = ψ(γ) for all γ ∈ Γ, and hence
[ψ] = [ψF ] in HW . On the other hand, (cid:92)PDψF (z) = F by (3.8), since (cid:99)ψF = F by

definition and F (γ) = (cid:98)ψ(γ). Hence, we obtain the desired conclusion.

The totally ordered structure of the subspaces of the de Branges space H(E) is de-

scribed by V (t) as follows.

Theorem 5.7. Assume that the RH is true. Then, E F(V (t)) is a de Branges subspace
of H(E) for every t ≥ 0 and is isometrically isomorphic to HW (t) up to a constant
multiple by the map of Theorem 1.1.

Proof. It is sufficient to prove the first half of the theorem, since the second half follows
from Theorem 5.5 (2). We prove the claim for positive t such that V (t) ̸= {0}, since
the case of t = 0 was proved in Lemma 5.1 and the claim is trivial if V (t) = {0}. The
following is essentially the same as the proof of [13, Lemma 4.3].

We show that H := E(z)F(V (t)) is a Hilbert space consisting of entire functions and

satisfies the axiom of the de Branges spaces:
(dB1) For each z ∈ C\R the point evaluation Φ (cid:55)→ Φ(z) is a continuous linear functional

on H.

R F (z)G(z)|E(z)|−2dz for F, G ∈ H.

Let Φ(z) = E(z)(Ff )(z) ∈ H with f ∈ V (t). First, we prove that H consists of
entire functions. We see that Φ(z) is holomorphic in C+ by f ∈ L2(t, ∞). If we write
(J♯f )(x) := f (−x), the commutative relation JF = FJ♯ holds. Therefore, using (5.1)
and K2 = 1, we have Φ(z) = E(z)(Ff )(z) = E♯(z)(FJ♯Kf )(z). This shows that Φ(z)
is also holomorphic in C−. Furthermore, J♯Kf ∈ L2(−∞, −t), because the tempered
distribution kernel k := F−1Θ of K has support in [0, ∞) by [10, Theorems 1.1 and 1.2].
On the real line, limz→x(Ff )(z) = (Ff )(x) and limz→x(FJ♯Kf )(z) = limz→x(FKf )♯(z) =
Θ♯(x)(Ff )(x) for almost all x ∈ R, where z is allowed to tend to x nontangentially from
C+ and C−, respectively. Hence, Φ(z) is also holomorphic in a neighborhood of each
point of R. By the above, Φ(z) is an entire function.

We confirm (dB1). For z ∈ C+, Φ (cid:55)→ Φ(z) = E(z) (cid:82) ∞

linear form. On the other hand, for z ∈ C−, Φ (cid:55)→ Φ(z) = E♯(z) (cid:82) −t

We confirm (dB2). We have Φ♯(z) = E(z)(FKf )(z). Since Kf ∈ V (t), the function

Φ♯ belongs to H. Since K is isometric, the equality of norms in (dB2) holds.

We confirm (dB3). The equality of norms in (dB3) is trivial by the definition of the
norm of H. From (dB2), it is sufficient to show only the case of w ∈ C+. Suppose that
Φ(w) = 0 for some w ∈ C+. Then (Ff )(w) = 0, since E(z) has no zeros on C+. We put
fw(x) := f (x) − i(w − ¯w) (cid:82) x−t
f (x − y)e−iwydy. Then we easily find that fw ∈ L2(t, ∞)
and (Ffw)(z) = ((z − ¯w)/(z − w))(Ff )(z) for z ∈ C+. Hence we complete the proof if it
is shown that Kfw has support in [t, ∞), since Kfw ∈ L2(R) by fw ∈ L2(t, ∞). We put
gw(x) := (Kf )(x) − i( ¯w − w) (cid:82) x−t
(Kf )(x − y)e−i ¯wydy. Then gw has support in [t, ∞)
by Kf ∈ L2(t, ∞) and (Fgw)(z) = ((z − w)/(z − ¯w))(FKf )(z) = (FKfw)(z) for z ∈ C+.
□
Hence gw = Kfw and the proof is completed.

We expect that V (t) ̸= 0 for some t > 0, or rather that V (t) ̸= 0 holds for all t ≥ 0,
but we do not discuss this in the present article, since it seems to be a nontrivial problem
related to the eigenfunctions of K, as mentioned in Remark 5.2.

5.1. A weaker variant of Corollary 1.5. Since the space V (0) can be constructed
unconditionally as well as V ◦(0) in Corollary 1.5, it can be used to state an equivalence
condition for the RH. However, since the construction of V (0) is simpler than that of
V ◦(0), more conditions are required for the equivalence condition.

Proposition 5.8. Let V (0) = L2(0, ∞) ∩ KL2(0, ∞) be as in (5.2). Then the RH is
true if and only if the following two conditions hold:
L2(R) = 2−1⟨ψ, ψ⟩W for every ψ ∈ V (0).

(1) ∥ψ∥2
(2) For a given γ ∈ Γ and any ϵ > 0, there exists ψ ∈ V (0) such that

(cid:98)ψ(−γ) = 1,

ϵ
|γ − γ′|1+δ
for some δ > 0 independent of γ, ϵ, and ψ.

| (cid:98)ψ(−γ′)| ≤

for every γ′ ∈ Γ \ {γ}

Proof. Assuming the RH, (1) follows from Theorem 5.5 (1). Also, (2) holds, since ψγ =
F−1(Fγ) in V (0) satisfies (cid:99)ψγ(γ) ̸= 0 and (cid:99)ψγ(γ′) = 0 for γ′ ∈ Γ \ {γ}.

Conversely, we assume that (1) and (2) are satisfied. Then, we show that a contra-
diction arises if the RH is false. We take a nonreal γ0 ∈ Γ. For any ϵ > 0, there exists
ψ1, ψ2 ∈ V (0) such that (cid:99)ψ1(−γ0) = i, (cid:99)ψ2(−γ0) = −i, |(cid:99)ψ1(−γ)| ≤ ϵ|γ0 − γ|−1−δ for every

γ ∈ Γ \ {γ0}, and |(cid:99)ψ2(−γ)| ≤ ϵ|γ0 − γ|−1−δ for every γ ∈ Γ \ {γ0} by (2). Then, for
ψ := ψ1 + ψ2 (̸= 0), we have ⟨ψ, ψ⟩W = (cid:80)
γ∈Γ mγ (cid:98)ψ(−γ)( (cid:98)ψ)♯(−γ) = −mγ0 + O(ϵ), since
(cid:80)
γ∈Γ mγ|γ|−1−δ < ∞. Therefore, ⟨ψ, ψ⟩W is negative for a sufficiently small ϵ > 0, but
□

it contradicts (1). Hence the RH holds.

6. Hilbert–P´olya space

One of attractive strategies for proving the RH is the construction of a Hilbert–P´olya
space, which is a pair of a Hilbert space and a self-adjoint operator acting on it such
that all nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta-function are eigenvalues of the self-adjoint
operator. In this section, we state that HW is one of Hilbert–P´olya spaces under the
RH. Note that HW is unconditionally defined as H0 by Theorem 5.6.

We assume the RH and denote E = Eξ as in Section 5. In this case, the domain D(M)
of the multiplication operator M on H(E) is dense in H(E), because Sθ(z) does not
belongs to H(E) for all θ ∈ [0, π) by the estimate |Sθ(iy)/E(iy)| ≫ (log y)−1 (y → +∞)
obtained by the Stirling formula for the gamma-function and [11, Proposition 2.1]. Using
M, we define the operator A := F−1MF on V (0) with the domain D(A) = F−1(D(M)).
If ψ ∈ V (0) is differentiable and ψ′ also belongs to V (0), then A ψ = iψ′. Further, we
define the operator AW on HW as follows.

By Theorem 5.6, the inverse of (5.9) from HW to V (0) is given by [ψ] (cid:55)→ F−1 (cid:100)PDψ.
Further, if we choose the representative of ψ from V (0), it is possible and uniquely de-
termined by Theorem 5.5 (2), and therefore ψ = F−1 (cid:100)PDψ. By choosing representatives
in this way, we define AW on HW by AW [ψ] = [Aψ]. By the same procedure as above,
the family of self-adjoint extensions Mθ of M determines the corresponding families of
self-adjoint extensions of A and AW (see (2.5) and (2.6)). By this correspondence, the
orthogonal basis {[ψγ]}γ∈Γ of HW consists of eigenvectors [ψγ] of AW,π/2 with eigenvalues
γ ∈ Γ, since {EFγ}γ∈Γ with (3.5) is an orthogonal basis of H(E) consists of eigenfunc-
tions of Mπ/2 with eigenvalues Γ (see Seciton 2.3). Therefore, the pair (HW , AW,π/2) is
a Hilbert–P´olya space.

It is important to note that the multiplicity of γ ∈ Γ as an eigenvalue of AW,π/2 (and
Mπ/2) is one. In other words, the multiplicity of γ ∈ Γ as a zero of ξ(1/2 − iz) is not
reflected in the multiplicity of AW,π/2 (and Mπ/2). In particular, it shows the explicit
difference between the de Branges space H(Eξ) and the de Branges space BS
λ in [4,
Section 4.8].

In the above discussion, we assumed the RH, but (2.5) and (2.6) allow us to define the

operator Mθ without the RH. However, its properties as an operator become unclear.

7. Special values of the screw line St(z)

The screw line St(z) has the following unconditional relations with the screw function
g(t). It is interesting that they are not a special case of equations obtained from the
general theory of screw functions.

Theorem 7.1. Let gξ(t) and Pt(z) be functions of (4.3) and (1.6), respectively. Then
the following equations hold independently of the truth of the RH:
