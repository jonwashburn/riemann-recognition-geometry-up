NEW EXPONENT PAIRS, ZERO DENSITY ESTIMATES, AND
ZERO ADDITIVE ENERGY ESTIMATES: A SYSTEMATIC
APPROACH

TERENCE TAO, TIM TRUDGIAN, AND ANDREW YANG

Abstract. We obtain several new bounds on exponents of interest in analytic
number theory, including four new exponent pairs, new zero density estimates
for the Riemann zeta-function, and new estimates for the additive energy of
zeroes of the Riemann zeta-function. These results were obtained by creating
the Analytic Number Theory Exponent Database (ANTEDB) to collect results
and relationships between these exponents, and then systematically optimising
these relationships to obtain the new bounds. We welcome further contribu-
tions to the database, which aims to allow easy conversion of new bounds on
these exponents into optimised bounds on other related exponents of interest.

1. Introduction

In this paper we introduce the Analytic Number Theory Exponent Database (AN-
TEDB)1, which aims to be a living database that systematically collects, abstracts,
develops code for, and optimises results and relations for, a number of exponents
that arise in analytic number theory. By an exponent, we mean one or more real
numbers, possibly depending on other exponent parameters, that occur as an expo-
nent in an analytic number theory estimate, for instance as the exponent in some
scale parameter T that bounds some other quantity of interest.
For the initial launch of the ANTEDB, we focused on exponents relating to the Rie-
mann zeta-function ζ(s). More specifically, in this paper we shall restrict attention
to the exponents listed in the following table.

We will review the definitions of these exponents in Section 2.1. The exponents
(k, ℓ), µ(α), A(σ), (and to a lesser extent, β(α)) are well known2 and extensively
studied as explicit quantities of interest in many places in the literature (e.g., in
[Ivi03]). However, many of the other exponents in the above table are only studied
implicitly, with specific values or bounds on these exponents often appearing in
auxiliary estimates used to control one of the more explicitly studied exponents
listed above. One of the objectives of the ANTEDB is to make these exponents
more explicit, and to identify and abstract the relationships between them that often
only appear in the literature in special cases (for instance, with certain parameters
set to specific numerical values).
The ANTEDB also contains some preliminary data on several other related ex-
ponents, such as those relating to gaps between primes. However these are less
developed at present, and we will not report on them in depth here.
There is a vast literature on bounding these various exponents, and on relating them
to each other. One resource for this literature is the text of Ivi´c [Ivi03], and many
of the most recent bounds may be found in a paper [TY23] by the second and third
authors. However, due to a steady stream of new results in the field (for instance,
the spectacular zero density estimates of Guth and Maynard [GM24]), any given
list of bounds in the literature will eventually become out of date. Furthermore,
many of the key relations between exponents are expressed in the literature in a way
that is tailored to the best numerical exponents available at the time of publication,
rather than in a more general and abstract fashion that could be easily applied to
subsequent work that can utilise improved exponent bounds.
To address these issues, we have attempted not only to collect all known bounds
on the above exponents in the ANTEDB, but also to “unpack” the proofs of these
exponents by abstracting out general relations between exponents that are implicit
in the literature, but not stated in the most general form suitable for future ap-
plications. A simple and well known example is the abstraction of the functional
equation of the Riemann zeta-function as a symmetry relation

(1)

µ(1 − σ) = µ(σ) + σ − 1/2

for the growth rates

(2)

µ(σ) := lim sup

t→∞

log |ζ(σ + it)|
log t

of the Riemann zeta-function (see, e.g., [Ivi03, (1.23), (1.25)]). A more implicit,
but also well known, example is the technique of Huxley subdivision, which is a
commonly used method in the theory of zero density estimates for extending large
value estimates on short intervals to large value estimates on long intervals. By
introducing the large value exponent LV(σ, τ ), which we define in Definition 27,
this subdivision method can be abstracted as the upper Lipschitz bound

LV(σ, τ ′) ≤ LV(σ, τ ) + τ ′ − τ
whenever 1/2 ≤ σ ≤ 1 and τ ≤ τ ′; see Lemma 28. By identifying these abstract
relations, one can automate some of the more “routine” processes in the literature,
such as the “standard arguments” appearing in [GM24] to pass from large value
theorems to zero density estimates (and thence to bounds on gaps between primes).
Such abstract relations combine to produce a complicated network of implications,
which often hinders manual optimisation an exponent bound given a set of known
results. For instance, an exponent pair (k, ℓ) (defined in Definition 11) may be

2There are some minor variations in notation in the literature regarding whether to permit
“epsilon losses” or to define the class of phase functions to which exponent pairs apply. See
Remark 1 and Example 6 below.

implied by other exponent pairs via a number of processes, as well as bounds on
various exponential sums that themselves depend on exponent pairs. However, this
paradigm appears to be well-suited for machine-assisted optimisation. In ANTEDB
we implement a python module that implements the set of known results and their
relations, as well as routines to find new results implied by a set of hypotheses. A
number of results recorded in this article were found in this way.
Thus, each theorem and conjecture in ANTEDB is represented both in human-
readable form as well as python code. As the literature of exponent bounds grows,
one may increasingly rely on machine-assistance to maintain an up-to-date record of
the best known bounds of various exponents, which may either be explicitly derived
or implied by novel upstream results. The aim of the ANTEDB python module
is to abstract away the tedious task of computing the consequences of a novel
intermediate result, thereby freeing up resources for researchers. For instance, if a
new large value estimate is discovered, one may use the ANTEDB python module
to find efficiently the best-possible new zero density estimates that are implied, and
compare these to zero density estimates already in the database.

Remark 1 (General note on notation). Throughout this paper, we adopt notational
conventions for exponents that allow for “epsilon losses” in the estimates. This is
done in order to simplify the presentation of the results (which would otherwise
require various additional ε terms), and for compatibility with the code in the AN-
TEDB, in which exponents are frequently stored as rational numbers to facilitate
exact arithmetic. Several of our the results may permit one or more of these ep-
silons to be replaced with more precise losses such as a logarithmic loss, or even with
a completely “log-free” estimate, but we have not pursued these refinements here or
in the ANTEDB. It is possible however that a future expansion of the ANTEDB
could also address these more refined questions.

1.1. New results. As a demonstration of the effectiveness of this systematic ap-
proach, we were able to obtain new exponent bounds purely from combining and op-
timising existing methods, without the introduction of new analytic number theory
inputs. The discovery of these bounds was very much computer assisted; however,
in many cases we were able to extract human-readable proofs from these computa-
tions, which we will present in this paper. We expect that future improvements on
these exponents coming from new techniques in analytic number theory can be sim-
ilarly combined with the machinery in the ANTEDB to allow these improvements
to propagate in an optimised and largely automated fashion.
Our new results can be summarised as follows:

• Four new exponent pairs (Theorem 20);
• Several new zero density estimates (Table 2); and
• New estimates for the additive energy of zeroes (see Theorem 64).

1.2. Future directions. We welcome contributions from the analytic number the-
ory community to maintain and expand the ANTEDB. Some natural directions of
expansion could include recording analogous exponents for various L-functions,
or to record estimates that only lose logarithmic factors rather than epsilon ex-
ponent losses, or even “log-free” or explicit estimates.
In the latter aspect, it
may eventually be possible to unify this database with the Th´eorie Multiplica-
tive Explicite des nombres / Explicit Multiplicative Number Theory website at
https://tmeemt.github.io/Chest/.
Currently, the ANTEDB python module performs computations using routines that
are not formally certified to be error-free. A natural future direction of the project
would be to incorporate formal verification in languages such as Lean. Completely

4

formalizing the estimates in the ANTEDB would be a significant challenge3; how-
ever, several conditional calculations deriving one exponent from other exponents
in the literature could conceivably be formalised within the ANTEDB.

2. Notation

2.1. Asymptotic notation. It is convenient to use a “cheap non-standard analy-
sis” framework for asymptotic notation, in the spirit of [Tao], as this will reduce the
amount of “epsilon management” one has to do in the arguments. This framework
is inspired by non-standard analysis, but we will avoid explicitly using non-standard
constructions such as ultraproducts in the discussion below, relying instead on the
more familiar notion of sequential limits. Any result stated here using this non-
standard framework can be converted without difficulty to a result in standard
“epsilon-delta” form; see for instance Lemma 10 for a typical example.
In this framework, we assume there is some ambient index parameter i, which ranges
over some ambient sequence of natural numbers going to infinity. All mathematical
objects X (numbers, sequences, sets, functions, etc.), will either be fixed — i.e.,
independent of i — or variable 4 - i.e., dependent on i. Of course, fixed objects
can be considered as special cases of variable objects, in which the dependency is
constant. By default, objects should be understood to be variable if not explicitly
declared to be fixed. For emphasis, we shall sometimes write X = Xi to indicate
explicitly that an object X is variable; however, to reduce clutter, we shall generally
omit mention of the parameter i in most of our arguments. We will often reserve the
right to refine the ambient sequence to a subsequence as needed, usually in order to
apply a compactness theorem such as the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem; we refer
to this process as “passing to a subsequence if necessary”. When we say that a
statement involving variable objects is true, we mean that it is true for all i in the
ambient sequence. For instance, a variable set E of real numbers is a set E = Ei
indexed by the ambient parameter i, and by an element of such a set, we mean a
variable real number x = xi such that xi ∈ Ei for all i in the ambient sequence.
We isolate some special types of variable numerical quantities X = Xi (which could
be a natural number, real number, or complex number):

• X is bounded if there exists a fixed C such that |X| ≤ C. In this case we

also write X = O(1).

• X is unbounded if |Xi| → ∞ as i → ∞; equivalently, for every fixed C, one

has |X| ≥ C for i sufficiently large.

• X is infinitesimal if |Xi| → 0 as i → ∞; equivalently, for every fixed ε > 0,
one has |X| ≤ ε for i sufficiently large. In this case we also write X = o(1).
Note that any quantity X will be either bounded or unbounded, after passing
to a subsequence if necessary; similarly, by the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, any
bounded (variable) quantity X will be of the form X0 +o(1) for some fixed X0, after
passing to a subsequence if necessary. Thus, for instance, if T, N > 1 are (variable)
quantities with N = T O(1) (or equivalently, T −C ≤ N ≤ T C for some fixed C),
then, after passing to a subsequence if necessary, we may write N = T α+o(1) for
some fixed real number α. Note that any further passage to subsequences does
not affect these concepts; quantities that are bounded, unbounded, or infinitesimal
remain so under any additional restriction to subsequences.

3For instance, the ongoing “Prime Number Theorem and more” project at https://github.
com/AlexKontorovich/PrimeNumberTheoremAnd, launched in January 2024, took approximately
four months to formalise the prime number theorem with qualitative error term, with the classical
error term bound still a work in progress at this time of writing.

4These correspond to the notions of standard and non-standard objects in non-standard

analysis.

EXPONENT PAIRS AND ZERO DENSITY ESTIMATES

We observe the underspill principle: if X, Y are (variable) real numbers, then the
relation

is equivalent to the relation

X ≤ Y + o(1)

X ≤ Y + ε + o(1)

holding for all fixed ε > 0.
We can develop other standard asymptotic notation in the natural fashion: given
two (variable) quantities X, Y , we write X = O(Y ), X ≪ Y , or Y ≫ X if |X| ≤ CY
for some fixed C, and X = o(Y ) if |X| ≤ cY for some infinitesimal c. We also write
X ≍ Y for X ≪ Y ≪ X.
A convenient property of this asymptotic formalism, analogous to the property
of ω-saturation in non-standard analysis, is that certain asymptotic bounds are
automatically uniform in variable parameters.

Proposition 2 (Automatic uniformity). Let E = Ei be a non-empty variable set,
and let f = fi : E → C be a variable function.

(i) Suppose that f (x) = O(1) for all (variable) x ∈ E. Then after passing to a
subsequence if necessary, the bound is uniform, that is to say, there exists
a fixed C such that |f (x)| ≤ C for all x ∈ E.

(ii) Suppose that f (x) = o(1) for all (variable) x ∈ E. Then after passing to a
subsequence if necessary, the bound is uniform, that is to say, there exists
an infinitesimal c such that |f (x)| ≤ c for all x ∈ E.

Proof. We begin with (i). Suppose that there is no uniform bound. Then for
any fixed natural number n, one can find arbitrarily large in in the sequence and
xin ∈ Ein such that |fin (xin)| ≥ n. Clearly one can arrange matters so that the
sequence in is increasing. If one then restricts to this sequence and sets x to be the
variable element xin of E, then f (x) is unbounded, a contradiction.
Now we prove (ii). We can assume for each fixed n that there exists in in the
ambient sequence such that |fi(xi)| ≤ 1/n for all i ≥ in and xi ∈ Ei, since if this
were not the case one can construct an x = xi ∈ E such that |fi(xi)| ≥ 1/n for
i sufficiently large, contradicting the hypothesis. Again, we may take the in to
be increasing. Restricting to this sequence, and writing cin := 1/n, we see that
□
c = o(1) and |f (x)| ≤ c for all x ∈ E, as required.

Remark 3. It is important in Proposition 2 that the hypotheses in (i), (ii) are
assumed for all variable x ∈ E, rather than merely the fixed x ∈ E. For instance,
let E = R and consider the variable function fi(x) := x/i. Then f (x) = o(1) for
any fixed x ∈ E, but the decay rate is not uniform, and we do not have f (x) = o(1)
for all variable x ∈ E (e.g., xi := i is a counterexample).

Remark 4. There are two caveats with this asymptotic formalism. First, the law
of the excluded middle is only valid after passing to subsequences. For instance, it
is possible for a non-standard natural number to be neither even nor odd, since it
could be even for some i and odd for others. However, one can pass to a subsequence
in which it becomes either even or odd. Second, one cannot combine the “external”
concepts of asymptotic notation with the “internal” framework of (variable) set
theory. For instance, one cannot view the collection of all bounded (variable) real
numbers as a variable set, since the notion of boundedness is not “pointwise” to
each index i, but instead describes the “global” behavior of this index set. Thus, for
instance, set builder notation such as {x : x = O(1)} should be avoided.

2.2. Phase functions. As a first use of this asymptotic notation, we define our
notion of phase functions used in the concept of an exponential pair. For simplicity
we restrict attention to phase functions that are (asymptotically) “monomial func-
tions” in the sense of [Hux96, Chapter 3], although many of the results discussed
here can likely be generalised to larger classes of phase functions.

Definition 5 (Phase function). A phase function is a (variable) smooth function
F : [1, 2] → R. A phase function F will be called a model phase function if there
exists a fixed exponent σ > 0 with the property that

(3)

F (p+1)(u) −

dp
dup u−σ = o(1)

for all (variable) u ∈ [1, 2] and all fixed p ≥ 0, where F (p+1) denotes the (p + 1)st
derivative of F .

Example 6. The function u (cid:55)→ log u is a model phase function (with σ = 1), and
for any fixed σ ̸= 1, u (cid:55)→ u1−σ/(1 − σ) is also a model phase function. Informally, a
model phase function is a function which asymptotically behaves like u (cid:55)→ log u (for
σ = 1) or u (cid:55)→ u1−σ/(1 − σ) (for σ ̸= 1), up to constants. This turns out to be a
good class for exponential sum estimates, as it is stable under Weyl differencing and
Legendre transforms, which show up in the van der Corput A-process and B-process
respectively. Results on exponential pairs can often extend to more general classes
of phase functions, but this class is sufficient for applications to the Riemann zeta-
function, and so we will not study any class beyond the model phase function class
here or in the ANTEDB. (However, such generalisations could be addressed in a
potential future expansion of the ANTEDB.)

Note from Proposition 2 that the o(1) decay rate in (3) can be made uniform, after
passing to a subsequence if necessary.

2.3. Additive energy. Additive energy is a concept that appears implicitly in the
work of Heath-Brown [HB79a], although the terminology of additive energy5 first
appears in [TV10]. As observed in that paper, controlling the additive energy of
zeroes of the Riemann zeta-function has implications for the distributions of primes
in short intervals. Additive energy of large values of Dirichlet series also played a
key role in the recent zero density estimates in [GM24].

Definition 7 (Additive energy). Let W be a finite multi-set of real numbers. The
additive energy E1(W ) of such a set is defined to be the number of quadruples
(t1, t2, t3, t4) ∈ W such that

|t1 + t2 − t3 − t4| ≤ 1.
One could more generally define Er(W ) for any r > 0 to be the number of quadru-
ples (t1, t2, t3, t4) ∈ W such that

but from [CT21, Lemma 3.1] we have the comparability relation

|t1 + t2 − t3 − t4| ≤ r,

5Strictly speaking, only the scale zero energy E0(W ) was introduced in [TV10], but the con-
cepts are related. For instance, if W ′ is the (multi-)set formed from W by rounding to the nearest
integer, then E1(W ) can be shown to be comparable to E0(W ′), as can be seen from (4) below.

2.4. Double zeta sums. Double zeta sums are a type of exponential sum that
arise frequently in the study of large value theorems and zero density estimates.
Given a (multi-)set W and a scale N > 1, let S(N, W ) denote the double zeta sum

S(N, W ) :=

We caution that this normalisation differs from the one in [Ivi03], where n−1/2−i(t−t′)
is used in place of n−i(t−t′). This sum may also be rearranged as

S(N, W ) =

play a key role in the arguments (actually for technical reasons some diagonal por-
tions of this sum, in which two of the t1, t2, t3 are close to each other, are removed).
In principle, estimates on such sums could also be systematically collected by the
ANTEDB, but we have not attempted to do this.

3. Exponential sum exponents, and exponent pairs

We now use the concept of a phase function to define the exponent sum growth
exponent function β(α).

Definition 9 (Exponent sum growth exponent). For any fixed α ≥ 0, let β(α) ∈
R denote the least possible (fixed) exponent for which the following claim holds:
whenever N, T ≥ 1 are (variable) quantities with T unbounded and N = T α+o(1),
F is a model phase function, and I ⊂ [N, 2N ] is an interval, then

e(T F (n/N )) ≪ T β(α)+o(1).

(cid:88)

n∈I

It is easy to see that the set of possible candidates for β(α) is closed (thanks to
underspill), non-empty, and bounded from below, so β is well-defined as a (fixed)

8

T. TAO, T. S. TRUDGIAN, AND A. YANG

function from [0, +∞) to R. Specializing to the logarithmic phase F (u) = log u,
and performing a complex conjugation, we see in particular that

n−iT ≪ T β(α)+o(1)

(cid:88)

n∈I

whenever T is unbounded, N = T α+o(1), and I is an interval in [N, 2N ]. Thus it is
clear that knowledge of β is relevant to understanding the Riemann zeta-function.
The quantity β(α) can also be formulated without asymptotic notation, but at the
cost of introducing some “epsilon and delta” parameters:

Lemma 10 (Non-asymptotic definition of β). Let α ≥ 0 and β ∈ R be fixed. Then
the following are equivalent:

(i) β(α) ≤ β.
(ii) For every (fixed) ε > 0 and σ > 0 there exists (fixed) δ > 0, P ≥ 1, C ≥ 1
with the following property: if T ≥ C, T α−δ ≤ N ≤ T α+δ are (fixed) real
numbers, I ⊂ [N, 2N ] is a (fixed) interval, and F is a (fixed) phase function
such that

Proof. It is easy to see that (ii) implies (i) by expanding out all the definitions (and
using Proposition 2 to resolve any uniformity issues). Conversely, suppose that (ii)
fails. Carefully negating all the quantifiers, we conclude that there exists a fixed
ε, σ > 0 such that for any (fixed) natural number i, one can find real numbers
T = Ti ≥ i, T α−1/i ≤ N = Ni ≤ T α+1/i, an interval I = Ii ⊂ [Ni, 2Ni], and a phase
function F = Fi such that

claim β(α) ≤ β.

It will be slightly more convenient technically to work with the asymptotic formu-
lation in this paper. Furthermore, we will primarily be interested in β in the range
0 ≤ α ≤ 1; for α > 1 one can use the Euler–Maclaurin formula (see e.g.
[Tit86,
(2.1.2)]) to obtain that β(α) = α − 1 in this regime.

with the following property: for all model phase functions F , all T ≥ N ≤ 1, and
all intervals I ⊂ [N, 2N ], one has

e(T F (n/N )) ≪ (T /N )k+o(1)N ℓ+o(1)

whenever T ≥ N ≥ 1, I is an interval in [N, 2N ], and F ∈ U.

Again, we can phrase this concept non-asymptotically:

Lemma 12 (Non-asymptotic definition of exponent pair). Let (k, ℓ) be a fixed
element of (10). Then the following are equivalent:

(i) (k, ℓ) is an exponent pair.
(ii) For every (fixed) ε > 0 there exist (fixed) C, P > 0 such that, whenever
T ≥ N ≥ 1, I ⊂ [N, 2N ], and F is a phase function obeying (7) for for all
(fixed) 0 ≤ p ≤ P and u ∈ [1, 2], then

The proof of this lemma is similar to that of Lemma 10 and is omitted.
We record some known processes that preserve exponent pairs:

Lemma 13 (Exponent pair processes). The space of exponent pairs is preserved
under the following processes:

(A) The A-process A : (k, ℓ) (cid:55)→ ( k
2k+2 ,

There exists a further process which almost preserves the space of exponent pairs,
which may be stated in terms of bounds on β.

In practice, this lemma implies that if (k, ℓ) is an exponent pair, then so is D(k, ℓ).
The relation between exponent pairs and the function β can be summarised as
follows.

Lemma 15 (Duality between exponent pairs and β). Let (k, ℓ) be in the triangle
(10). Then the following are equivalent:
(i) (k, ℓ) is an exponent pair.
(ii) β(α) ≤ k + (ℓ − k)α for all 0 ≤ α ≤ 1.

Proof. If (i) holds, then for any 0 < α < 1, any unbounded T ≥ 1, any N = T α+o(1),
interval I ⊂ [N, 2N ], and model phase function F , we have from (i) that

e(T F (n/N )) ≪ (T /N )k+o(1)N ℓ+o(1) = T k+(ℓ−k)α+o(1).

(cid:88)

n∈I

From Definition 9 we conclude that β(α) ≤ k + (ℓ − k)α. Also since (k, ℓ) lies in
(10), we see from (8) that we also have β(α) ≤ k + (ℓ − k)α for α = 0, 1.
Now suppose that (ii) holds. Let F, T, N, I be as in Definition 11. By underspill it
suffices to show that

e(T F (n/N )) ≪ (T /N )k+ε+o(1)N ℓ+ε+o(1)

(cid:88)

n∈I

for any fixed ε > 0. We may assume that T ≤ N 1/ε+1, since the claim follows
from the trivial bound (cid:80)
n∈I e(T F (n/N )) ≪ N otherwise. We may also assume
that N is unbounded, since the claim is clear for N bounded; this forces T to be
unbounded as well.
By passing to a subsequence we may assume that N = T α+o(1) for some fixed
0 ≤ α ≤ 1. By Definition 9 we then have

e(T F (n/N )) ≪ T β(α)+o(1)

(cid:88)

n∈I

e(T F (n/N )) ≪ (T /N )k+o(1)N ℓ+o(1)

(cid:88)

n∈I

and hence by (ii)

giving the claim.

□

Remark 16. When applying Lemma 15 in the case ℓ − k ≥ 1/2, it suffices in
(ii) to restrict to the range 0 ≤ α ≤ 1/2, as the remaining range 1/2 ≤ α ≤ 1 is
then covered by the symmetry (9). Similarly, when applying Lemma 15 in the case
ℓ − k ≤ 1/2, it suffices to restrict to the range 1/2 ≤ α ≤ 1.

The main conjecture on exponent pairs and β is then

Conjecture 17 (Exponent pair conjecture).

(i) Every point in the triangle (10) is an exponent pair. In particular, (0, 1/2)

is an exponent pair.

(ii) We have

β(α) =

(cid:40)

0 ≤ α ≤ 1

α/2,
α − 1, α > 1

.

In view of Lemma 15, the two components of this conjecture are equivalent.
A large number of bounds on exponential sums can be interpreted as piecewise-
linear upper bounds on β(α) in various ranges of α; see e.g. [TY23, Table 3] (which
in turn builds upon [Hux96, Tables 17.1, 19.2]). For many of these results, a larger
class of phase functions can be treated but we ignore this direction of generalisation

for simplicity. There are additional bounds in the literature that are not covered
by these tables. To give just one example, we present

Proof. Let T ≥ 1 be unbounded, let N = T α+o(1), let F be a model phase function,
and I ⊂ [N, 2N ] be an interval. Writing f (x) := T F (x/N ), we see from (3) that
0 < λk < f (k)(x) ≤ Aλk
for all x ∈ [N, 2N ] and some λk ≍ T N −k = T 1−kα+o(1) and A ≍ 1. Applying
[HB17, Theorem 1], we conclude that

e(T F (n/N )) ≪ N 1+ε(λ1/k(k−1)

□

Remark 19. From the proof of Lemma 18 we see that the result in [HB17, Theorem
1] is somewhat stronger than the bound on β presented here, because that result
handles more general phase functions than model phase functions. However, in
order to combine results from different papers as easily as possible, we have restricted
attention to model phase functions, as discussed in Example 6.

can then combine these with the A, D processes from Lemma 13 and Lemma 14 to
obtain further pairs, which give bounds on β thanks to Lemma 15. When combined
with the bounds from [TY23, Table 3], one obtains the upper bounds on β(α) in
Table 1 (with the bounds already listed in [TY23, Table 3] marked with an asterisk).
With this improved table of β estimates, one obtains the following four new expo-
nent pairs, which are plotted in Figure 1 and Figure 2.

The results in Table 1 were found systematically using a programmable part of the
ANTEDB implemented in Python, which we briefly introduce here. The library
records theorems and conjectures from the literature as Hypothesis objects. Each
Hypothesis either directly references a result from the literature, or contains a de-
pendency set of other Hypothesis objects as well as a proof attribute that specifies
how the dependencies are assembled into a proof. For instance, the exponent pair
(1/6, 2/3) can be represented in the database as a Hypothesis with two dependen-
cies: one representing the A process (with no dependencies of its own) and another
representing the (1/2, 1/2) exponent pair.
Equipped with a (large) set of Hypothesis objects representing known exponent
pairs and bounds on β, as well as how they relate to one another, one may use a
number of routines in the ANTEDB to combine those objects optimally. Here, we

describe a polytope-based computation that may be easily generalised for optimis-
ing many other exponents recorded in the database. First, the starting Hypothesis
set is repeatedly expanded using codified versions of Lemma 13, Lemma 14 and
Lemma 15 until an equilibrium is reached. The key idea is then to represent each β
estimate as a polygon containing feasible (α, β) tuples, and then to take the inter-
section of all such polygons, which is easily achieved via standard boolean polytope
operations. The resulting polygon may then be converted back into one or more
Hypothesis objects representing a piecewise-linear bound on β.
This machine-assisted approach uncovers a number of improvements to manually-
derived β bounds, particularly those bounds depending on multiple applications of
exponent pair processes.
Lastly, for future reference, we also record a weaker exponent pair, needed for
Theorem 50 below, that can be obtained from older results in the literature:

Definition 22 (Growth rate of ζ(s)). For any fixed σ ∈ R, let µ(σ) denote the
least possible (fixed) exponent for which one has the bound

for all unbounded t.

|ζ(σ + it)| ≪ |t|µ(σ)+o(1)

Non-asymptotically, µ(σ) is the least quantity such that for every ε > 0 there exists
Cε > 0 for which one has the bound

|ζ(σ + it)| ≤ Cε|t|µ(σ)+ε

whenever |t| ≥ Cε. Equivalently, one can define µ by the formula (2).
It is classical (see, e.g., [Tit86, Chapter 5]) that µ is convex, obeys the functional
equation (1), and obeys the lower bound

µ(σ) ≥ max(0, 1/2 − σ)

for all σ ∈ R. The Lindel¨of hypothesis asserts that this lower bound is always sharp;
this is known for σ ≤ 0 or σ ≥ 1. Many partial results towards this conjecture, in
the form of upper bounds for µ, are known; we refer the reader to the ANTEDB
for a current listing of all known bounds.
We have the following well-known relation between exponent pairs and µ:

Lemma 23 (Exponent pairs and µ). If (k, ℓ) is an exponent pair, then µ(ℓ−k) ≤ k.

Proof. See e.g. [Ivi03, (7.57)].

□

Thus for instance the exponent pair conjecture implies the Lindel¨of conjecture. Of
course, one could combine this lemma with Theorem 20 or Theorem 21. We just
record the latter combination below.

Corollary 24 (Bound on µ). We have µ(7/10) ≤ 3/40.

EXPONENT PAIRS AND ZERO DENSITY ESTIMATES

5. Large value theorems

It is well known that zero density estimates for ζ(s) (and other L-functions) are
closely tied to large value theorems for Dirichlet polynomials; see for instance
[MT24] for some recent discussion of this relationship. We can formalise the latter
by introducing the concept of a large value pattern, as follows. Call a sequence an
of complex numbers 1-bounded if |an| ≤ 1 for all n in the sequence, and call a set
W of real numbers 1-separated if |t − t′| ≥ 1 for all distinct t, t′ ∈ W .

Definition 25 (Large value pattern). A large value pattern is a tuple

(N, T, V, (an)n∈[N,2N ], J, W ),
where N > 1 and T, V > 0 are real numbers, an is a 1-bounded sequence on [N, 2N ],
J is an interval of length T , and W is a 1-separated subset of J such that

A zeta large value pattern is a large value pattern in which J = [T, 2T ] and an =
1I (n) for some interval I ⊂ [N, 2N ], so that

Remark 26. In the literature, one also considers large value patterns in which the
sequence an is not controlled in an ℓ∞ sense, but rather in an ℓ2 sense. However,
the ℓ∞ control is sufficient for many applications of interest, particularly as we are
permitting epsilon losses in the exponents (which in particular allows one to use
the elementary divisor bound τ (n) ≪ no(1) to ignore any losses relating to divisor
sums). Such ℓ2-variants of large value patterns are not currently studied in the
ANTEDB, but could conceivably be addressed in a future expansion of the database.

The key quantity of interest is then

Definition 27 (Large value exponent). Let 1/2 ≤ σ ≤ 1 and τ ≥ 0 be fixed. We
define LV(σ, τ ) ∈ [−∞, ∞) to be the least fixed quantity for which the following
claim is true: whenever (N, T, V, (an)n∈[N,2N ], J, W ) is a large value pattern with
N > 1 unbounded, T = N τ +o(1), and V = N σ+o(1), then

|W | ≪ N LV(σ,τ )+o(1).

We define LVζ(σ, τ ) similarly, but where (N, T, V, (an)n∈[N,2N ], J, W ) is now re-
quired to be a zeta large value pattern.

As with previous definitions, this exponent can be expressed non-asymptotically:
LV(σ, τ ) is the infimum of all real numbers ρ such that for every (fixed) ε > 0 there
exists C, δ > 0 such that if

(N, T, V, (an)n∈[N,2N ], J, W )
is a large value pattern with N ≥ C and N τ −δ ≤ T ≤ N τ +δ, N σ−δ ≤ V ≤ N σ+δ,
then one has

|W | ≤ CN ρ+ε.
One can define LVζ(σ, τ ) non-asymptotically in a similar fashion. In the definition
of LV(σ, τ ), one has the freedom to translate the interval J by any shift t0 by
modulating the coefficients an by n−it0. As such, one can normalise J to be [0, T ]

16

T. TAO, T. S. TRUDGIAN, AND A. YANG

without loss of generality for this quantity. However, we do not have this freedom
for LVζ(σ, τ ), since in that case the coefficients an are required to equal 1.
We begin with a discussion of the function LV(σ, τ ). It is easy to see that LV(σ, 0) =
0 for all 1/2 ≤ σ ≤ 1. We can also formalise the Huxley subdivision method (see,
e.g., [IK04, Corollary 9.9]) as a functional inequality for LV:
Lemma 28 (Huxley subdivision). If 1/2 ≤ σ ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ τ ≤ τ ′, then

LV(σ, τ ) ≤ LV(σ, τ ′) ≤ LV(σ, τ ) + τ ′ − τ.
Proof. This is clear since any interval of length N τ ′+o(1) can be subdivided into
N τ ′−τ +o(1) intervals of length N τ +o(1).
□

We stress that the subdivision inequality is only available for LV(σ, τ ) and not for
LVζ(σ, τ ), due to the aforementioned lack of freedom to translate the interval J in
the latter case.
Lemma 28 leads to a lower bound for LV(σ, τ ) in general:

Lemma 29 (Lower bound). For σ = 1/2, one has LV(σ, τ ) = τ . For 1/2 < σ ≤ 1,
one has LV(σ, τ ) ≥ min(2 − 2σ, τ ).

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

(cid:80)

Proof. For the σ = 1/2 case, one can set an = ±1 to be random signs, and then
n∈[N,2N ] ann−it(cid:12)
(cid:12)
a routine application of the Chernoff inequality shows that
(cid:12) =
N 1/2+o(1) with high probability for any given t, which gives the claim.
For 1/2 < σ ≤ 1, we can modify this argument as follows. By Lemma 28 it
suffices to show that LV(σ, 2 − 2σ) ≥ 2 − 2σ. Divide the interval [N, 2N ] into
≍ N 2−2σ intervals I of length ≍ N 2σ−1. On each interval I, we choose an to
equal some randomly chosen sign ϵI ∈ {−1, +1}, with the ϵI chosen independently
n∈I ann−it is equal to ϵI times a deterministic

quantity ct,I of magnitude ≍ N 2σ−1 (the point being that the phase t log n is close
to constant in this range). By the Chernoff bound, we thus see that for any such t,

If t = o(N 2−2σ), then (cid:80)

The Montgomery conjecture essentially asserts that this lower bound is sharp:

Conjecture 30 (Montgomery conjecture). One has LV(σ, τ ) = min(2 − 2σ, τ ) for
all 1/2 < σ ≤ 1 and τ ≥ 0. Equivalently (thanks to Lemma 29 and the trivial bound
LV(σ, τ ) ≤ τ ), one has LV(σ, τ ) ≤ 2 − 2σ for all 1/2 < σ ≤ 1 and τ ≥ 0.

One can phrase this conjecture in the equivalent form

standard dyadic decomposition of W into O(log N ) = O(N o(1)) components de-
pending on the dyadic size of | (cid:80)

slightly different notation) in [Bou91, (1.6)] and is attributed to Montgomery as a
correction of his original conjecture in [Mon71], which was shown in the former pa-
per to be too strong to be completely correct. In that paper it was also shown that
the conjecture (12) implies the Kakeya conjecture in geometric measure theory.
From the trivial upper bound LV(σ, τ ) ≤ τ we see that the Montgomery conjecture
is true for τ ≤ 2 − 2σ. The range of validity of the conjecture can be extended. For
instance, we have

Theorem 31 (L2 mean value theorem). For any fixed 1/2 ≤ σ ≤ 1 and τ ≥ 0 one
has

In particular, the Montgomery conjecture holds for τ ≤ 1.

LV(σ, τ ) ≤ max(2 − 2σ, 1 + τ − 2σ).

Proof. Let (N, T, V, (an)n∈[N,2N ], J, W ) be a large value pattern with T = N τ +o(1),
V = N σ+o(1). Applying [IK04, Theorem 9.4] (with N , T replaced with 2N , 2T
respectively and taking an = 0 for n < N ) one has

We record some further results of this type in the literature, again valid for any
fixed 1/2 ≤ σ ≤ 1 and τ ≥ 0:

(i) The Huxley large values theorem [Hux72, Equation (2.9)], in our notation,

gives the upper bound

(13)

LV(σ, τ ) ≤ max(2 − 2σ, 4 + τ − 6σ).

In particular, one has the Montgomery conjecture for τ ≤ 4σ − 2.
(ii) The Heath-Brown large values theorem [HB79c, p. 226] similarly gives

(14)

LV(σ, τ ) ≤ max(2 − 2σ, 10 + τ − 13σ).

In particular, the Montgomery conjecture holds for τ ≤ 11σ − 8.

(iii) The Jutila large values theorem [Jut77, (1.4)] gives, for any positive integer

k, the bound

(15)

LV(σ, τ ) ≤ max(2 − 2σ, τ + (4 − 2/k) − (6 − 2/k)σ, τ + (6 − 8σ)k).

In particular, the Montgomery conjecture holds for

τ ≤ min((4 − 2/k)σ − (2 − 2/k), (8k − 2)σ − 6k + 2).

There are several further large value theorems in the literature, though not nec-
essarily of a type that further extends the range of validity of the Montgomery
conjecture; for instance, the recent result [GM24, Theorem 1.1] of Guth and May-
nard, in our notation, gives the bound

(16)

LV(σ, τ ) ≤ max(2 − 2σ, 18/5 − 4σ, τ + 12/5 − 4σ).

We refer the reader to the ANTEDB for a current listing of all known large value
theorems.
We now record a large value theorem of Bourgain [Bou00], stated here in more
generality than was explicitly stated in that paper, and restated in our notation for
compatibility with the other results listed here.

Theorem 32 (Bourgain large values theorem). [Bou00] Let 1/2 < σ < 1 and
τ > 0, and let ρ := LV(σ, τ ). Let α1, α2 ≥ 0 be real numbers.

(i) Either

(17)

ρ ≤ max(α2 + 2 − 2σ, −α2 + 2τ + 4 − 8σ, −2α1 + τ + 12 − 16σ)

or else there exists s ≥ 0 such that

18

T. TAO, T. S. TRUDGIAN, AND A. YANG

(ii) [Bou00, Lemma 4.60] If we additionally assume ρ ≤ min(1, 4 − 2τ ), then

ρ ≤ max(α2 + 2 − 2σ, α1 + α2/2 + 2 − 2σ, −α2 + 2τ + 4 − 8σ,
− 2α1 + τ + 12 − 16σ, 4α1 + 2 + max(1, 2τ − 2) − 4σ).

Proof. We begin with (i). By Definition 27, we can find a large value pattern
(N, T, V, (an)n∈[N,2N ], J, R) with N > 1 unbounded, N ≥ 1, T = N τ +o(1), |R| =
N ρ+o(1), V = N σ+o(1); we use R here instead of W to be consistent with the
notation from [Bou00]. Now set δ1 := N −α1, δ2 := N −α2 . From [Bou00, (4.41),
(4.42)], one has the inequality

for certain sets R(1) and R(2) with the former set obeying the bound

|R| ≤ |R(1)| + |R(2)|

|R(1)| ≪ δ−1

2 N 2V −2 + δ2T 2N 4V −8 + δ2

1T N 12V −16.

Hence, we either have

|R| ≪ δ−1

2 N 2V −2 + δ2T 2N 4V −8 + δ2

1T N 12V −16

which implies (17), or else

(19)

|R| ≪ |R(2)|.

Henceforth we assume that (19) holds. From [Bou00, (4.53), (4.54)] we may bound

(20)

thus

T −εδ′(δ′′)2V 2|S||R(2)| + T −εδ1V 2|S|1/2 (cid:88)

|Rα|3/2

α

≪ T εS(N, R(2))1/2S(N, S)1/2
for arbitrarily small fixed ε, some δ′, δ′′ > 0 with δ′ > T −ε(δ1/δ′′)2 (see [Bou00,
(4.37)]), some set S (which will be non-empty by [Bou00, (4.47)]), and some sets
Rα defined in [Bou00, (4.39)], where the double zeta sums S(N, W ) are defined in
(6). Applying [HB79b, Theorem 1] or [Ivi03, Lemma 11.5], the latter expression is
bounded by

≪ T ε(|R|N 2 + |R|2N + |R|5/4T 1/2N )1/2(|S|N 2 + |S|2N + |S|5/4T 1/2N )1/2.

Meanwhile, from [Bou00, (4.57)], the expression (20) is bounded from below by

≫ T −2ε(δ2

1V 2|S||R| + δ1δ1/2

2 V 2|S|1/2|R|3/2).

After passing to a subsequence, we can ensure that |S| = N s+o(1) for some s > 0.
Combining these bounds and writing all expressions as powers of N , we obtain the
claim (i) (after sending ε → 0).
Now we prove (ii). With ρ ≤ min(1, 4 − 2τ ), 5ρ/4 + τ /2 + 1 and 2ρ + 1 are both
bounded by ρ + 2, hence

max(ρ + 2, 2ρ + 1, 5ρ/4 + τ /2 + 1) = ρ + 2.

Furthermore, 5s/4 + τ + 1 is a convex combination of s + 2 and 2s + 2τ − 2, hence

max(s + 2, 2s + 1, 5s/4 + τ /2 + 1) ≤ max(s + 2, 2s + max(1, 2τ − 2)).

Thus (18) simplifies to

(ρ + 2)/2 + max(s + 2, 2s + max(1, 2τ − 2))/2

≥ max(−2α1 + 2σ + s + ρ, −α1 − α2/2 + 2σ + s/2 + 3ρ/2).

Thus either

or

(ρ + 2)/2 + (s + 2)/2 ≥ −α1 − α2/2 + 2σ + s/2 + 3ρ/2

(ρ + 2)/2 + (2s + max(1, 2τ − 2))/2 ≥ −2α1 + 2σ + s + ρ.

EXPONENT PAIRS AND ZERO DENSITY ESTIMATES

19

In both cases we may eliminate s and solve for ρ to obtain

ρ ≤ α1 + α2/2 + 2 − 2σ

or

giving the claim.

ρ ≤ 4α1 + 2 + max(1, 2τ − 2) − 4σ,

□

The standard trick of increasing the range of applicability of large value theorems
by raising Dirichlet series to powers can also be cleanly encoded in our framework:

Lemma 33 (Raising to a power). For any fixed 1/2 ≤ σ ≤ 1, τ ≥ 0, and natural
number k, one has

LV(σ, kτ ) ≤ kLV(σ, τ ).

Proof. Let (N, T, V, (an)n∈[N,2N ], J, W ) be a large value pattern with T = N kτ +o(1)
and V = N σ+o(1). Raising (11) to the kth power, we conclude that

of the form [N ′, 2N ′] for N ′ ≍ N k and applying Definition 27 (with N, T, V replaced
by N ′, T, V k/N o(1)) we conclude that

|W | ≪ N kLV(σ,τ )+o(1)

and the claim then follows.

□

5.1. Large value theorems for the zeta-function. Now we discuss the related
quantity LVζ(σ, τ ). We trivially have the pointwise bound

(21)

LVζ(σ, τ ) ≤ LV(σ, τ ).

We will primarily be interested in this function in the regime τ ≥ 2, as this is the
region relevant to the Riemann–Siegel formula (or other approximate functional
equations) for the Riemann zeta-function, and in any event the 1 < τ < 2 range
can be related to the τ > 2 range using Lemma 34(iii) below.
Additional bounds are available through pointwise or moment bounds on the zeta-
function, as well as from the (approximate) functional equation:

Lemma 34 (Additional bounds).

(i) If τ > 0 and 1/2 ≤ σ0 ≤ 1 are fixed, then LVζ(σ, τ ) = −∞ whenever

σ > σ0 + τ µ(σ0).

(ii) If one has a moment estimate of the form

(22)

(cid:90) 2T

T

|ζ(σ0 + it)|A ≪ T M +o(1)

for some fixed 1/2 ≤ σ0 ≤ 1 and A ≥ 1, and all unbounded T , then
LVζ(σ, τ ) ≤ τ M − A(σ − σ0) for any fixed 1/2 ≤ σ ≤ 1 and τ ≥ 2.

The claim follows.
For (ii), let (N, T, V, (an)n∈[N,2N ], J, W ) be a zeta large value pattern with N un-

By hypothesis, the left-hand side is ≪ T M +o(1). Since T = N α+o(1), we obtain

|W | ≪ N τ M −A(σ−σ0),

giving the claim.

Remark 35. The arguments for (ii) can be reversed, in that the optimal exponent
M in the indicated moment bound can be shown to be

M = sup

(A(σ − σ0) + LVζ(σ, τ ))/τ.

τ ≥2;σ≥1/2

We refer the reader to the ANTEDB for a proof. Thus the moment exponents for
the zeta-function are in some sense dual to the function LVζ, somewhat analogously
to the relationship between exponent pairs and the function β in Lemma 15.

Remark 36. We note that in practice, bounds for LVζ(σ′, τ ) + σ′ are monotone
decreasing6 in σ′, so the reflection property in Lemma 34(iii) morally simplifies7 to

The well-known twelfth moment bound of Heath–Brown [HB78] gives (22) with
σ0 = 1/2, A = 12, and M = 2. Combining this with Lemma 34(ii), we see that

(25)

LVζ(σ, τ ) ≤ 2τ − 12(σ − 1/2)

any fixed 1/2 ≤ σ ≤ 1 and τ ≥ 2. In a similar vein, using the specific bound on µ
in Corollary 24, we concude that

LVζ(σ, τ ) = −∞

(26)
whenever τ > 0 and 1/2 ≤ σ ≤ 1 are such that σ > 7
There are several further results in the literature that can be viewed as bounds on
LVζ, or relationships between LVζ and other quantities such as exponent pairs; we
refer to the ANTEDB for a current listing of all known results of this type.

10 + 3

40 τ .

Our convention for zero density exponents will be as follows.

6. Zero density estimates

Definition 37 (Zero density exponents). For σ ∈ R and T > 0, let N (σ, T )
denote the number of zeroes ρ of the Riemann zeta-function with Re(ρ) ≥ σ and
|Im(ρ)| ≤ T .
If 1/2 ≤ σ < 1 is fixed, we define the zero density exponent A(σ) ∈ [−∞, ∞) to be
the infimum of all (fixed) exponents A for which one has

whenever T is unbounded and δ > 0 is infinitesimal.

N (σ − δ, T ) ≪ T A(1−σ)+o(1)

In non-asymptotic terms: A(σ) is the infimum of all A such that for every ε > 0
there exists C, δ > 0 such that

N (σ − δ, T ) ≤ CT A(1−σ)+ε

whenever T ≥ C. Note that in other literature (e.g., [Ivi03]), the shift by δ is not
present, but this only affects the value of A(σ) at discontinuities of the function.
As N (σ, T ) is obviously monotone non-increasing in σ, we certainly have the bound
N (σ, T ) ≪ T A(σ)(1−σ)+o(1)

for any fixed 1/2 ≤ σ < 1 and unbounded T .
The key conjecture for this exponent is

Conjecture 38 (Density hypothesis). One has A(σ) ≤ 2 for all 1/2 ≤ σ < 1.

6This reflects the fact that large value theorems usually relate to pth moment bounds for p ≥ 1

(e.g., p = 2, 4, 6, 12) rather than for 0 < p < 1.

7One could redefine LVζ to use smooth cutoffs in the n variable rather than rough cutoffs

1I (n), whence one could obtain the analogue of (24) rigorously, but we do not do so here.

EXPONENT PAIRS AND ZERO DENSITY ESTIMATES

23

Of course, the Riemann hypothesis gives the even stronger assertion A(σ) = −∞
for all 1/2 < σ < 1. We refer the reader to [Tit86, Chapter 9] for further discussion
of the density hypothesis. From the Riemann–von Mangoldt formula one sees that

(27)

A(1/2) = 2

so that the bound of 2 in the density hypothesis cannot be reduced.
It is well known (see, e.g., [IK04, Chapter 10]) that zero density estimates can be ob-
tained from large value theorems through the device of zero detecting polynomials.
We formalise this principle as follows:

Lemma 39 (Zero density from large values). Let 1/2 < σ < 1. Then

A(σ)(1 − σ) ≤ max(sup
τ ≥2

LVζ(σ, τ )/τ, lim sup
τ →∞

LV(σ, τ )/τ ).

Proof. Write the right-hand side as B, then B ≥ 0 (from Lemma 29) and we have

(28)

for all τ ≥ 1, and

(29)

LVζ(σ, τ ) ≤ Bτ

LV(σ, τ ) ≤ (B + ε)τ

whenever ε > 0 and τ is sufficiently large depending on ε (and σ). It would suffice
to show, for any ε > 0, that N (σ − o(1), T ) ≪ T B+O(ε)+o(1) as T → ∞.
By dyadic decomposition, it suffices to show for large T that the number of zeroes
with real part at least σ − o(1) and imaginary part in [T, 2T ] is ≪ T B+O(ε)+o(1).
From the Riemann–von Mangoldt formula, there are only O(log T ) zeroes whose
imaginary part is within O(1) of a specified ordinate t ∈ [T, 2T ], so it suffices to
show that given some zeroes σr + itr, r = 1, . . . , R with σ − o(1) ≤ σr < 1 and
tr ∈ [T, 2T ] 1-separated, that R ≪ T B+O(ε)+o(1).
Suppose that one has a zero σr +itr of this form. Then by a standard approximation
to the zeta-function [Ivi03, Theorem 1.8], one has

(cid:88)

n≤T

nσr+itr

≪ T −1/2.

Let 0 < δ1 < ε be a small quantity (independent of T ) to be chosen later, and let
0 < δ2 < δ1 be sufficiently small depending on δ1, δ2. By the triangle inequality,
and refining the sequence tr by a factor of at most 2, we either have

R ≪ N LV(σ,τ )+o(1) = T LV(σ,τ )/τ +o(1)

and the claim follows in this case from (29).

Recently, a partial converse to the above lemma was established:

Lemma 40 (Large values from zero density). [MT24, Theorem 1.2] If τ > 0 and
1/2 ≤ σ ≤ 1 are fixed, then

and t1, . . . , tR ∈ [T, 2T ] be 1-separated with

Here, the implied constant is understood to be uniform in δ. Letting δ go to zero,
□
and using the easily verified left-continuity of A, we obtain the claim.

The suprema in Lemma 39 require unbounded values of τ , but thanks to the ability
to raise to a power, we can reduce to a bounded range of τ . Here is a basic such
reduction, suited for machine-assisted proofs:

26

T. TAO, T. S. TRUDGIAN, AND A. YANG

Corollary 41. Let 1/2 < σ < 1 and τ0 > 0. Then

A(σ)(1 − σ) ≤ max

(cid:18)

sup
2≤τ <τ0

LVζ(σ, τ )/τ,

sup
τ0≤τ ≤2τ0

LV(σ, τ )/τ

(cid:19)

with the convention that the first supremum is −∞ if it is vacuous (i.e., if τ0 < 2).

Proof. Denote the right-hand side by B, thus

LV(σ, τ ) ≤ Bτ

for all τ0 ≤ τ ≤ 2τ0, and

(31)

LVζ(σ, τ ) ≤ Bτ

whenever 2 ≤ τ < τ0. From Lemma 33 we then have

LV(σ, τ ) ≤ Bτ

for all kτ0 ≤ τ ≤ 2kτ0 and natural numbers k. Note that the intervals [kτ0, 2kτ0]
cover all of [τ0, ∞), hence we have

for all τ ≥ τ0. In particular

LV(σ, τ ) ≤ Bτ

lim sup
τ →∞

LV(σ, τ )/τ ≤ B.

Also, combining the previous estimate with (31) and (21) we have

LVζ(σ, τ ) ≤ Bτ

for all τ ≥ 2. By Lemma 34(iii), this implies that

The claim now follows from Lemma 39.

□

For machine assisted proofs, one can simply take τ0 to be a sufficiently large quan-
tity, e.g., τ0 = 3 for σ not too close to 1, and larger for σ approaching 1, to recover
the full power of Lemma 39. However, the amount of case analysis required in-
creases with τ0. For human written proofs, the following version of Corollary 41 is
more convenient:

Corollary 42. Let 1/2 < σ < 1 and τ0 > 0. Then

A(σ)(1 − σ) ≤ max

(cid:32)

sup
2≤τ <4τ0/3

LVζ(σ, τ )
τ

sup
2τ0/3≤τ ≤τ0

(cid:33)

LV(σ, τ )

Proof. Applying Corollary 41 with τ replaced by 4τ0/3, it suffices to show that

sup
4τ0/3≤τ ≤8τ0/3

LV(σ, τ )
τ

≤

sup
2τ0/3≤τ ≤τ0

LV(σ, τ )

.

But this follows from Lemma 33, since the intervals [2kτ0/3, kτ0] for k = 2, 3 cover
□
all of [4τ0/3, 8τ0/3].

The following special case of Corollary 42 is frequently (implicitly) used in practice
to assist with the human readability of zero density proofs:

EXPONENT PAIRS AND ZERO DENSITY ESTIMATES

27

Corollary 43. Let 1/2 < σ < 1 and τ0 > 0. Suppose that one has the bounds

(32)

LV(σ, τ ) ≤ (3 − 3σ)

τ
τ0

for 2τ0/3 ≤ τ ≤ τ0, and

(33)

LVζ(σ, τ ) ≤ (3 − 3σ)

τ
τ0

for 2 ≤ τ < 4τ0/3. Then A(σ) ≤ 3
τ0

.

The reason why this particular special case is convenient is because the inequality

(34)

2 − 2σ ≤ (3 − 3σ)

τ
τ0

obviously holds for τ ≥ 2τ0/3. That is to say, we automatically verify (32) in
regimes where the Montgomery conjecture holds. In fact, we can do a bit better,
thanks to subdivision:

Corollary 44. Let 1/2 < σ < 1 and τ0 > 0. Suppose that one has the bound (33)
for 2 ≤ τ < 4τ0/3, and the Montgomery conjecture LV(σ, τ ) ≤ 2 − 2σ whenever
0 ≤ τ ≤ τ0 + σ − 1. Then A(σ) ≤ 3
τ0

.

Proof. We may assume that τ0 ≥ 3 − 3σ, since otherwise we can use the bound

A(σ)(1 − σ) ≤ A(1/2)(1 − 1/2) = 1

coming from (27) and the monotonicity properties of N (σ, T ). By Lemma 28 we
have

LV(σ, τ ) ≤ max(2 − 2σ, 3 − 3σ + τ − τ0)
for all τ ≥ 0. But both expressions on the right-hand side are bounded by (3−3σ) τ
τ0
□
for 2τ3 ≤ τ ≤ τ0 and τ0 ≥ 3 − 3σ, so the claim follows from Corollary 43.

With this machinery we can now quickly recover some existing zero density theo-
rems, both conditional and unconditional. For instance, we have

Theorem 45. The Montgomery conjecture implies the density hypothesis.

Proof. Apply Corollary 43 with τ0 = 3/2 (so that (33) is vacuously true).

□

Theorem 46. [Ing40], [HT69] The Lindel¨of hypothesis implies the density hypoth-
esis, and also that A(σ) ≤ 0 for 3/4 < σ ≤ 1.

Proof. We will apply Corollary 42. From Lemma 34(i) and the Lindel¨of hypothesis
we have

sup
2≤τ <4τ0/3

LVζ(σ, τ )/τ ≤ 0.

From Theorem 31 and Lemma 33 we have

LV(σ, τ ) ≤ max((2 − 2σ)k, τ + (1 − 2σ)k)

for any natural number k and τ ≥ 1; setting k to be the integer part of τ we
conclude in particular that

LV(σ, τ ) ≤ (2 − 2σ)τ + O(1),
and hence by taking τ0 large enough, we can make sup2τ0/3≤τ ≤τ0 LV(σ, τ )/τ bounded
by 2 − 2σ + ε for any ε > 0. This already gives the density hypothesis bound
A(σ) ≤ 2. For σ > 3/4, we may additionally apply [HT69, Theorem 1] to obtain
the Montgomery conjecture in this setting for all τ , thus allowing one to make
□
sup2τ0/3≤τ ≤τ0 LV(σ, τ )/τ arbitrarily small, giving the bound A(σ) ≤ 0.

Theorem 47 (Ingham’s bound). [Ing40] For any 1/2 < σ < 1, one has A(σ) ≤
3
2−σ .

28

T. TAO, T. S. TRUDGIAN, AND A. YANG

Proof. We apply Corollary 44 with τ0 := 2 − σ. Here we have 4τ0/3 < 2 since
σ > 1/2, so the claim (33) is automatic; and the Montgomery conjecture hypothesis
□
follows from Theorem 31.

Theorem 48 (Huxley bound). [Hux72] For any 1/2 < σ < 1, one has A(σ) ≤
3σ−1 . (In particular, the density hypothesis holds for σ ≥ 5/6.)
Proof. We apply Corollary 44 with τ0 := 3σ − 1. The Montgomery conjecture
hypothesis follows from (13). So it remains to show that (33) holds for 2 ≤ τ <
4τ0/3. For σ ≤ 5/6 we have 4τ0/3 ≤ 2, so the claim is vacuously true. For σ > 5/6
6 , 2
we use Lemma 34(i), Lemma 23 and the classical exponent pair AB(0, 1) = ( 1
3 )
to conclude that LVζ(σ, τ ) = −∞ whenever σ > 1/2 + τ /6, but this is precisely
□
τ < 6σ − 3. Since 6σ − 3 > 4τ0/3 when σ > 5/6, we obtain the claim.

Theorem 49 (Guth–Maynard bound). For any 1/2 < σ < 1, one has A(σ) ≤
15
3+5σ .

Proof. We may assume that 7/10 < σ < 8/10, since the bound follows from the
Ingham and Huxley bounds otherwise. We apply Corollary 43 with τ0 := 3+5σ
.
We have 4τ0/3 < 2, so the claim (33) is vacuous and we only need to establish (32).
We split into the subranges 13/5 − 2σ ≤ τ < τ0 and 2τ0/3 ≤ τ ≤ 13/5 − 2σ. In the
former range we use (16) (and (34)), and reduce to showing that

5

and

18/5 − 4σ ≤ (3 − 3σ)

τ
τ0

,

τ + 12/5 − 4σ ≤ (3 − 3σ)

τ
τ0

for 13/5 − 2σ ≤ τ < τ0. The first inequality follows from

(35)

18/5 − 4σ ≤ (3 − 3σ)

13/5 − 2σ
τ0

which can be verified numerically in the range 7/10 < σ < 8/10. Finally, the third
inequality is actually an equality when τ = τ0 and the right-hand side has a larger
slope in τ than the left (since τ0 ≥ 3 − 3σ), so the claim follows as well.
In the remaining region 2τ0/3 ≤ τ ≤ 13/5 − 2σ, we use Theorem 31 and (34) to
reduce to showing that

τ + 1 − 2σ ≤ (3 − 3σ)

τ
τ0

in this range. This follows again from (35) which guarantees the inequality at the
□
right endpoint τ = 13/5 − 2σ.

6.1. New zero density estimates. The previous zero density estimates were al-
ready known in the literature. By computer-assisted optimisation, we were able
to use the same set of tools to obtain some new zero density estimates. The
optimisation procedure is a higher-dimensional analogue of the program used to
produce Table 1; however instead of considering feasible (α, β) tuples, one now
combines known large value estimates into a (σ, τ, LV(σ, τ )) feasible region (and
zeta large value estimates into a (σ, τ, LVζ(σ, τ )) feasible region). The quantities
sup2τ0/3≤τ ≤τ0 LV(σ, τ )/τ and sup2≤τ ≤4τ0/3 LVζ(σ, τ )/τ may then be computed as
solutions to well-defined constrained optimisation problems.

1, one has

A(σ) ≤

10σ − 7

.

EXPONENT PAIRS AND ZERO DENSITY ESTIMATES

29

This result was previously obtained in the region 3/4 ≤ σ ≤ 25/28 by Heath-Brown
[HB79c]. The main new ingredient is the exponent pair in Theorem 21 (leading in
particular to (26), which was not available at the time of that paper).

Proof. We apply Corollary 44 with τ0 := 10σ − 7.
To verify (32), we now use Theorem 14 and (34), and reduce to showing that

τ + 10 − 13σ ≤ (3 − 3σ)

τ
τ0

for 2τ0/3 ≤ τ ≤ τ0. The inequality holds at τ = τ0 since τ0 ≤ 10σ − 7, and hence
for all smaller τ since τ0 ≥ 3 − 3σ.
From (26) we have we have LVζ(σ, τ ) = −∞ whenever σ > 3
τ < 4

10 , or equivalently
□

3 (10σ − 7), which then immediately gives (33).

40 τ + 7

Next, we recall a well-known result of Bourgain [Bou00] that the density hypothesis
A(σ) ≤ 2 holds for all σ > 25
32 . By abstracting and then using computer assistance
to optimise the arguments in that paper, we were able to improve this bound. Below
is a translation of the computer-assisted argument to human-readable form.

A(σ) ≤ max

for 38/49 ≤ σ ≤ 4/5.

Proof. We apply Corollary 44 with τ0 := min( 9(3σ−2)

of 2τ − 12(σ − 1/2) in τ exceeds that of τ
(3 − 3σ) by (36), it suffices to check the
τ0
bound at the endpoint, i.e., to show that

8τ0/3 − 12(σ − 1/2) ≤ 4 − 4σ

or equivalently τ0 ≤ 3(4σ−1)
Now we prove (37). Set ρ := LV(σ, τ ). From the k = 3 case of (15) we have

With this choice, the expressions α1 + α2/2 + 2 − 2σ and −2α1 + τ + 12 − 16σ are

and hence

α2 ≥ 5τ /4 − (1 + σ).

As before, we conclude that the quantities α1 +α2/2+2−2σ and −2α1 +τ +12−16σ

are both equal to τ

For (41) we argue as before to reduce to showing that

In [Bou95] the following zero density theorem was proven:

Theorem 52 (Bourgain zero density theorem). [Bou95, Proposition 3] Let (k, ℓ)
be an exponent pair with k < 1/5, ℓ > 3/5, and 15ℓ + 20k > 13. Then, for any
σ > ℓ+1

2(k+1) , one has

assuming either that k < 11

85 , or that 11

5 and σ > 144k−11ℓ−11

170k−22

.

A(σ) ≤

4k
2(1 + k)σ − 1 − ℓ
85 < k < 1

This result was combined with some known exponent pairs to obtain new zero
density bounds on A(σ). It was remarked in that paper that further exponent pairs
could be used to improve the bounds. This is easy to achieve computationally in
our framework, and we record the results here:

The desired result follows from applying Theorem 52 and taking a minimum over
the implied bounds. Note that sharper bounds are possible close to σ = 1 by
choosing other exponent pairs, however it turns out such results are superseded by
□
other zero density estimates.

We record the current best known zero density estimates proven in the literature,
or in this paper in Table 2.

6.2. A heuristic for zero density estimates. We can now state a rough heuristic
as to what zero density estimates to expect from a given large value theorem:

Heuristic 54 (Predicting a zero density estimate from a large value theorem).
Suppose that 1/2 ≤ σ ≤ 1 and τ0 ≥ 1 are such that one can prove LV(σ, τ0) ≤ 3−3σ
(i.e., the Montgomery conjecture holds here with a multiplicative loss of 3/2). Then
in principle, one can hope to prove A(σ) ≤ 3/τ0. Conversely, if one cannot prove
LV(σ, τ0) ≤ 3 − 3σ, then the bound A(σ) ≤ 3/τ0 is likely out of reach.

this paper are marked in bold. Results labelled with an asterisk
also appear in [TY23, Table 2].

We justify this heuristic as follows, though we stress that the arguments that follow
are not fully rigorous. In the first part, we simply apply Corollary 43. In practice,
the (32) is often more delicate than (33) and ends up being the limiting factor
for the bounds; furthermore, within (32), it is the right endpoint τ = τ0 of the
range 2τ0/3 ≤ τ ≤ τ0 that ends up being the bottleneck; but this is precisely the
claimed criterion LV(σ, τ0) ≤ 3 − 3σ. We remark that in some cases (particularly
for σ close to one), the estimate (33) ends up being more of the bottleneck than
(32), and so one should view 3/τ0 here as a theoretical upper limit of methods
rather than as a guaranteed bound. (In particular, the need to establish the bound
LVζ(σ, 4
3 τ0 − ε) < 4 − 4σ for ε > 0 small can sometimes be a more limiting factor.)

Figure 3. The bounds in Table 2, compared against the existing
literature bounds on A(σ), with differences shaded grey.

Conversely, suppose that

(44)

LV(σ, τ0) > 3 − 3σ,

but that one still wants to prove the bound A(σ) ≤ 3/τ0. Heuristically, Theorem 40
suggests that in order to do this, it is necessary to establish the bound LVζ(σ, τ )/τ ≤
3
τ0

(1 − σ) for all τ ≥ 2. In particular, one should show that

LVζ(σ, 2τ0) ≤ 6 − 6σ.

Let us consider the various options one has to do this. There are ways to control zeta
large values that do not apply to general large value estimates, such as moment
estimates of the zeta-function, exponent pairs, or control of β and µ. However,
at our current level of understanding, these techniques only control LVζ(σ, τ ) for
relatively small values of τ , and in practice 2τ0 is too large for these methods to
apply; this exponent also tends to be too large for direct application of standard
large value theorems to be useful. Hence, the most viable option in practice is
raising to a power (Lemma 33), using

LVζ(σ, 2τ0) ≤ kLVζ(σ, 2τ0/k)

for some natural number k ≥ 2. However, the most natural choice k = 2 is blocked
due to our hypothesis (44), while in practice the k ≥ 3 choice is blocked because of
Lemma 29. Hence it appears heuristically quite difficult to establish A(σ) ≤ 3/τ0
with current technology, in the event that (44) occurs.
In Table 3 we show how some of the large value theorems proven above are in
agreement with Heuristic 54 for at least some ranges of σ. Further examples can
be found in the ANTEDB.

7. Additive energy

Using the concept of additive energy from Definition 7, we can define additive
energy versions of the exponents LV(σ, τ ), LVζ(σ, τ ), and A(σ):

Definition 55 (Large value exponent for energy). Let 1/2 ≤ σ ≤ 1 and τ ≥ 0
be fixed. We define LV∗(σ, τ ) to be the least fixed quantity for which the following
claim is true: whenever (N, T, V, (an)n∈[N,2N ], J, W ) is a large value pattern with
N > 1 unbounded, T = N τ +o(1), and V = N σ+o(1), then

E1(W ) ≪ N LV∗(σ,τ )+o(1).

We define LV∗
quired to be a zeta large value pattern.

ζ(σ, τ ) similarly, but where (N, T, V, (an)n∈[N,2N ], J, W ) is now re-

Definition 56 (Zero density exponents for energy). For σ ∈ R and T > 0, let
N ∗(σ, T ) denote the additive energy of the imaginary parts of zeroes ρ of the Rie-
mann zeta-function with Re(ρ) ≥ σ and |Im(ρ)| ≤ T .
If 1/2 ≤ σ < 1 is fixed, we define the zero density exponent A∗(σ) ∈ [−∞, ∞) to be
the infimum of all (fixed) exponents A∗ for which one has

N ∗(σ − δ, T ) ≪ T A∗(1−σ)+o(1)

whenever T is unbounded and δ > 0 is infinitesimal.

Remark 57. It is theoretically possible (though not believed to be likely) that two
zeroes of ζ to the right of the critical line have the same imaginary part, in which
case the set of imaginary parts may contain multiplicity. However, by the Riemann–
von Mangoldt formula, this multiplicity can only affect the additive energy by a
factor of O(logO(1) T ) at most, and thus has no impact on the exponent A∗(σ).

From the easy bounds

|W |2 ≪ E1(W ) ≪ |W |3

we see that

Definition 58 (Large value energy region). The large value energy region E ⊂ R5
is defined to be the set of all fixed tuples (σ, τ, ρ, ρ∗, s) with 1/2 ≤ σ ≤ 1, τ, ρ, ρ′ ≥ 0,
such that there exists a large value pattern (N, T, V, (an)n∈[N,2N ], J, W ) with N > 1
unbounded, V = N σ+o(1), T = N τ +o(1), V = N σ+o(1), |W | = N ρ+o(1), E1(W ) =
N ρ∗+o(1) and S(N, W ) = N s+o(1).
We define the zeta large value energy region Eζ ⊂ R5 similarly, but where now
(N, T, V, (an)n∈[N,2N ], J, W ) is required to be a zeta large value pattern.

By the usual arguments, one can define this region without using asymptotic nota-
tion:

Lemma 59 (Non-asymptotic form of large value energy region). Let 1/2 ≤ σ ≤ 1,
τ ≥ 0, ρ, ρ∗ ≥ 0, and s ∈ R be fixed. Then the following are equivalent:

(i) (σ, τ, ρ, ρ∗, s) ∈ E.
(ii) For every ε > 0 and C > 0, there exists a large value pattern

(N, T, V, (an)n∈[N,2N ], J, W )

with N ≥ C, N τ −δ ≤ T ≤ N τ +δ, N σ−δ ≤ V ≤ N σ+δ, N ρ−ε ≤ |W | ≤
N ρ+ε, N ρ∗−ε ≤ E1(W ) ≤ N ρ∗+ε, and N s−ε ≤ S(N, W ) ≤ N s+ε.

A similar statement is true with E replaced by Eζ, and with (N, T, V, (an)n∈[N,2N ], J, W )
required to be a zeta large value pattern.

The quantities LV∗(σ, τ ), LV∗
by the formulae

ζ(σ, τ ) can now be expressed in terms of these regions

(46)

and

(47)

LV∗(σ, τ ) = sup{ρ∗ : (σ, τ, ρ, ρ∗, s) ∈ E}

LV∗

ζ(σ, τ ) = sup{ρ∗ : (σ, τ, ρ, ρ∗, s) ∈ Eζ}.

We have the following analogue of Lemma 39:

A∗(σ)(1 − σ) ≤ max

for all τ ≥ 1, and

(49)

LV∗

ζ(σ, τ ) ≤ Bτ

LV∗(σ, τ ) ≤ (B + ε)τ

whenever ε > 0 and τ is sufficiently large depending on ε (and σ). It would suffice
to show, for any ε > 0, that N ∗(σ, T ) ≪ T B+O(ε)+o(1) for unbounded T .
By dyadic decomposition, it suffices to show for unbounded T that the additive
energy of imaginary parts of zeroes in [T, 2T ] is ≪ T B+O(ε)+o(1). As in the proof
of Lemma 39, we can assume the imaginary parts are 1-separated (here we take
advantage of the triangle inequality (5) for additive energy).
Suppose there is a zero σ′ + it of this form. Then by [Ivi03, Theorem 1.8], one has

nσ′+it ≪ T −1.

Let 0 < δ1 < ε be a small fixed quantity to be chosen later, and let 0 < δ2 < δ1 be

for some interval I in some [N, 2N ] with T δ1 ≪ N ≪ T , with at most O(log T )

for some t′ = t + O(T o(1)); refining the t by a factor of T o(1) if necessary, we
may assume that the t′ are 1-separated and that the interval I is independent of
t′, and by passing to a subsequence we may assume that T = N τ +o(1) for some
1 ≤ τ ≤ 1/δ1, then

for all t′. If we let Σ′ denote the set of such t′, then by Definition 55 we then have
(for δ2 small enough) we have

E1(Σ′) ≪ N LV∗

ζ (σ,τ )+ε+o(1) ≪ T LV∗

ζ (σ,τ )/τ +ε+o(1).

Let Σ denote the set of imaginary parts of zeroes under consideration (after the
passage to subsequences indicated previously). By construction, each element of Σ
lies within T o(1) of an element of Σ′, and by the Riemann–von Mangoldt formula
there are at most T o(1) elements of Σ in any unit interval. Standard additive energy
calculations (e.g., using (4)) then gives the bound

E1(Σ) ≪ T LV∗

ζ (σ,τ )/τ +ε+o(1).

and the claim follows in this case from (48).
The Type II case similarly follows from (49) exactly as in the proof of Lemma
□
39.

By repeating the proof of Corollary 41, we obtain

Corollary 61. Let 1/2 < σ < 1 and τ0 > 0 be fixed. Then
(cid:18)

A∗(σ)(1 − σ) ≤ max

sup
2≤τ <τ0

LV∗

ζ(σ, τ )/τ,

sup

LV∗(σ, τ )/τ

Thus, to obtain upper bounds on A∗(σ), it suffices to control the quantities LV∗
ζ(σ, τ ),
LV∗(σ, τ ), and by (46), (47), it suffices to control the large value energy regions E, Eζ.
In analogy with Lemma 33, we would expect the region E to be closed under the
operation (σ, τ, ρ, ρ∗, s) (cid:55)→ (σ, τ /k, ρ/k, ρ∗/k, s/k). Due to some technical issues
(having to do with the fact that the additive energy or double zeta sum may un-
expectedly drop when passing to a subsequence), we were not able to prove this
claim as stated; however we have the following serviceable substitute.

Lemma 62 (Raising to a power). If (σ, τ, ρ, ρ∗, s) ∈ E, and k ≥ 1, then amongst
all tuples (σ, τ /k, ρ′, (ρ′)∗, s′) ∈ E with ρ′ ≤ ρ/k, (ρ′)∗ ≤ ρ∗/k, and s′ ≤ s/k, there
exists a tuple with ρ′ = ρ/k, there exists a tuple with (ρ′)∗ = ρ∗/k, and there exists
a tuple with s′ = s/k. (These may be three different tuples.)

Proof. By definition, there exists a large value pattern (N, T, V, (an)n∈[N,2N ], J, W )
with N > 1 unbounded, T = N τ +o(1), V = N σ+o(1), |W | = N ρ+o(1), E1(W ) =
N ρ∗+o(1), and S(N, W ) = N s+o(1). Observe that

In particular, partitioning [N k, 2kN k] into
O(1) sub-intervals [N ′, 2N ′] with N ′ = N k+o(1), we can partition W into O(1)
subcollections WN ′, such that

for all t ∈ WN ′. Again by the pigeonhole principle, one of the WN ′ must have
cardinality N ρ+o(1), one must have energy N ρ∗+o(1), and one must have double
zeta sum N s+o(1) (but these may be different WN ′). Each of these WN ′ then give
□
the different conclusions to the lemma.

Now we turn to the estimation of additive energy exponent A∗(σ). Besides the triv-
ial upper bound A∗(σ) ≤ 3A(σ), the best upper bounds for A∗(σ) in the literature
remain that of Heath–Brown [HB79c], who showed for any fixed 1/2 ≤ σ ≤ 1 that
A∗(σ) could be bounded by

10 − 11σ
(2 − σ)(1 − σ)
18 − 19σ
(4 − 2σ)(1 − σ)

for 1/2 ≤ σ ≤ 2/3;

for 2/3 ≤ σ ≤ 3/4;

12
4σ − 1

for 3/4 ≤ σ ≤ 1.

A key input in the analysis was the following relation between additive energy and
size of a large value pattern:

Theorem 63 (Heath-Brown relation). [HB79c] If (σ, τ, ρ, ρ∗, s) ∈ E, then one has

Proof. If (σ, τ, ρ, ρ∗, s) ∈ E then by Definition 58, there exists a large value pattern
(N, T, V, (an)n∈[N,2N ], J, W ) with N > 1 unbounded, V = N σ+o(1), T = N τ +o(1),
V = N σ+o(1), |W | = N ρ+o(1), E1(W ) = N ρ∗+o(1) and S(N, W ) = N s+o(1). Apply-
ing [HB79c, (33)] (and adjusting the notation appropriately), we conclude that

E1(W ) ≪ T εN 1−2σ(|W |N + |W |2 + |W |5/4T 1/2)1/2

× (E1(W )N + |W |4 + E1(W )3/4N T 1/2)1/2.

Comparing exponents, we obtain the claim.

□

Given the work on large value estimates since the time of Heath-Brown’s paper,
it is not surprising that we are able to improve on these bounds in several ranges.
Our main result (Theorem 64 below) is obtained using an optimisation routine
that may be viewed as a higher-dimensional analogue of the method used to derive

EXPONENT PAIRS AND ZERO DENSITY ESTIMATES

39

Table 1. Each theorem in the literature relating the quantities σ, τ , ρ, ρ∗ and s,
such as Theorem 63 or any large value estimate, is represented as a five-dimensional
polytope containing feasible (σ, τ, ρ, ρ∗, s) tuples. The polytopes are combined by
taking their intersection, then projected onto the (σ, τ, ρ∗) dimensions. For each
fixed σ, an upper bound of A∗(σ)(1 − σ) may be calculated as sup ρ∗/τ where the
supremum is taken over all tuples in the polytope projection (with σ fixed).
This process generates a machine “proof”, which, while not certifiably correct due
to issues of code fidelity, provides a blueprint for the rough steps required to arrive
at a formal proof. The machine-generated proofs are then transcribed manually
into human-readable proofs which are available in the ANTEDB.

for all (σ, τ, ρ, ρ∗, s) ∈ Eζ such that 2 ≤ τ ≤ τ0. The desired result (i) then follows
from Corollary 61 and computing the piecewise maximum of (50) and (51).
First, consider (51). Suppose that (σ, τ, ρ, ρ∗, s) ∈ Eζ with 3/4 ≤ σ ≤ 5/6 and
2 ≤ τ ≤ τ0. Then, from (25) we have

(cid:19)

(52)

ρ ≤ 2τ − 12(σ − 1/2).

Furthermore, by (13) and Lemma 33 with k = 2, one has ρ ≤ 2 max(2 − 2σ, 4 −
6σ + τ /2). However since τ ≤ τ0 = 8σ − 4, this simplifies to

(53)

ρ ≤ 4 − 4σ.

Since σ ≥ 3/4, this also implies that ρ ≤ 1. For future reference we also note that

by inspecting growth rates in τ and noting that at τ = 4σ − 1 one has equality.

which is (51).
Now consider (50). Suppose that τ0 ≤ τ ≤ 2τ0 and (σ, τ, ρ, ρ∗, s) ∈ E. Note that
the interval [τ0, 2τ0] is covered by intervals Ik := [(4σ − 2)k, (4σ − 2)(k + 1)] with
k = 2, 3. Suppose that τ ∈ Ik, and write

Then, by (13) and τ ′ ≥ 4σ − 2 one has

τ ′ := τ /k.

ρ/k ≤ max(2 − 2σ, 4 − 6σ + τ ′) = 4 − 6σ + τ ′.

Also, from (13) and τ ≤ (4σ − 2)(k + 1) one has

ρ/(k + 1) ≤ max(2 − 2σ, 4 − 6σ + τ /(k + 1)) ≤ 2 − 2σ

so that for k = 2, 3 one has ρ/k ≤ (2 − 2σ)(k + 1)/k ≤ 3 − 3σ. In summary,

(55)

ρ/k ≤ min(3 − 3σ, 4 − 6σ + τ ′).

Next, by Lemma 62,

(σ, τ ′, ρ′, ρ∗/k, s′) ∈ E

for τ ′ := τ /k and some ρ′ ≤ ρ/k and s′ ≤ s/k.
Applying Theorem 63 to this tuple, then applying ρ′ ≤ ρ/k, one has
