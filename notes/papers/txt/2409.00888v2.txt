M -FUNCTIONS AND SCREW FUNCTIONS :
APPLICATIONS TO GOLDBACH’S PROBLEM AND
ZEROS OF THE RIEMANN ZETA-FUNCTION

KOHJI MATSUMOTO AND MASATOSHI SUZUKI

Abstract. We study the M -functions, which describe the limit theorem for the value-
distributions of the secondary main terms in the asymptotic formulas for the summa-
tory functions of the Goldbach counting function. One of the new aspects is a sufficient
condition for the Riemann hypothesis provided by some formulas of the M -functions,
which was a necessary condition in previous work. The other new aspect is the re-
lation between the secondary main terms and the screw functions, which provides
another necessary and sufficient condition for the Riemann hypothesis. We study such
M -functions and screw functions in generalized settings by axiomatizing them.

related to the Goldbach conjecture, where Λ(n) is the von Mangoldt function defined by
Λ(n) = log p if n = pk for some prime number p with k ∈ Z>0 and Λ(n) = 0 otherwise.
The series H(X) is real-valued, since the set of nontrivial zeros of ζ(s) is closed under
complex conjugation. The asymptotic formula

Riemann hypothesis, which asserts that ℜ(ρ) = 1/2 for all nontrivial zeros ρ. After
that, R(X) = O(X 1+ε) was conjectured by Egami and Matsumoto [8], and R(X) =
O(X(log X)5) was proven by Bhowmik and Schlage-Puchta [2] under the Riemann hy-
pothesis. The conditional error term has been improved to O(X(log X)3) by Languasco
and Zaccagnini [21] and later by Goldston and Yang [14] by a different method. These
two estimates are close to the omega result Ω(X log log X) obtained in [2]. There are
other interesting studies on the relation between formula (1.2) and zeros of the Riemann
zeta function, such as Bhowmik and Ruzsa [1], Billington, Cheng, Schettler, and Suri-
ajaya [3], and references therein, but we will not discuss them in detail here, since the
subject of this paper is the value-distribution of somewhat general sums including (1.1).

for X ≥ 1 ([11, p. 249]).

Concerning the value of H(X), first, it is bounded under the Riemann hypothe-
sis, more precisely |H(X)/2| < 0.023059 ([23, (1.7)]), due to the absolute conver-
gence of the series. Fujii [12] proved that H(X)/2 > 0.012 for infinitely many X and
H(X)/2 < −0.012 for infinitely many X. Mossinghoff and Trudgian [23] improved
these inequalities into H(X)/2 > 0.021030 and H(X)/2 < −0.022978. They derived
the results by assuming only the Riemann hypothesis. The first author [22] proved more
detailed results for the value-distribution of H(X) further assuming the linear indepen-
dence over rationals for the set of positive imaginary parts of the nontrivial zeros.

We first highlight a few results which are later proved in a more general context.

Theorem 1.1. We assume the Riemann hypothesis and the linear independence over
rationals for the set of positive imaginary parts of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann
zeta function. Then, there exists an explicitly constructible density function MH : R →
R≥0, for which

(1.4)

holds for any test function Φ : R → C which is locally Riemann integrable. The function
MH (u) is continuous, nonnegative, compactly supported, and

(cid:82)
R MH (u) du = 1.

1√

2π

We immediately obtain this result as a corollary of [22, Theorem 2.3] (see also the
proof of Corollary 2.1 below). We refer to the function MH appearing in formula (1.4)
as the M -function, following [15] and [22]. Note that the Riemann hypothesis is not
assumed in [22, Theorem 2.3], because it studies the series

X iℑ(ρ)
ρ(ρ + 1)

,

(cid:88)

ρ

not the series (1.1).

Assuming the Riemann hypothesis, |X ρ−1/2| = 1 in (1.1). Thus, the absolute con-
vergence of H(X) implies its boundedness. The compactness of the support of MH (u)
in formula (1.4) is a consequence of the boundedness of H(X) under the Riemann hy-
pothesis (see the proof of Theorem 1.1 after Corollary 2.1). As the converse of Theorem
1.1, we observe that the boundedness of H(X) follows from formula (1.4). On the other
hand, as will be shown in the more general setting in Section 3, boundedness of H(X)
implies that all i(ρ − 1/2) are real (cf. Corollary 3.1), that is, the Riemann hypothesis
holds. Therefore, we obtain the following:

Theorem 1.2. We assume that the formula (1.4) holds for a compactly supported con-
tinuous function MH : R → R and for any test function Φ : R → C which is locally
Riemann integrable. Then H(X) is bounded, and hence the Riemann hypothesis holds.

This is a special case of Corollary 3.2. In (1.4), the function MH is a nonnegative
function, but it is not assumed to be nonnegative in Theorem 1.2 because it is not
necessary for the proof.

and E(X) is the error term estimated as E(X) ≪ X −2R(X) + (cid:82) ∞
X y−3R(y)dy using
partial summation. Conversely, formula (1.2) with the estimate R(X) ≪ X 2E(X) +
(cid:82) X
1 yE(y)dy can be derived from (1.6) by partial summation (see Section 7 for details).
In this sense, the contributions of series H(X) and H1(X) to the Goldbach problem are
equivalent. Furthermore, the argument in [22] can be applied to H1(X), and therefore
results similar to Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 hold for H1(X) (Corollary 2.1 and Theorem 3.1
below).

The series H1(X) also appears in the study of Euler’s totient function as follows

(Nicolas [25, Theorem 1.1, p. 319]), where C0 is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. From
the definition, the constant c2 in (1.7) may be considered an analog of C0.

To discuss the advantages of H1(X), we briefly review the class of screw functions
according to Kre˘ın and Langer [20]. A continuous function g(t) on R is called a screw
function on R if it satisfies g(−t) = g(t) for all t ∈ R and the kernel

Gg(t, u) := g(t − u) − g(t) − g(−u) + g(0)

is nonnegative definite on R×R, that is, (cid:80)n
i,j=1 Gg(ti, tj) ξiξj ≥ 0 for any n ∈ Z>0, ti ∈ R,
and ξi ∈ C. The class of screw functions was introduced as a natural generalization
of positive definite functions and is an interesting subject related to various topics in
analysis as explained in [20, Section 1]. That class has recently been applied to the
study of the zeta function by the second author [27]. The series H1(X) is related to the
theory of screw functions as follows.

Theorem 1.3. The function

is a screw function on R if and only if the Riemann hypothesis holds.

gH1(t) := H1(et) − H1(1)

This is a special case of Corollary 4.1. It shows a remarkable property of H1(X) that
H(X) does not have. In fact, any relation between the latter and a screw function is not
known. Further, the M -function of H1(X) relates to an infinitely divisible distribution
via the attached screw function. A distribution µ on R is called infinitely divisible if
there exists a distribution µn on R such that µ = µn ∗ · · · ∗ µn (n-fold) for every positive
integer n. We find that if g(t) is a screw function, then exp(g(t)) is the characteristic
function of an infinitely divisible distribution by [20, Theorem 5.1] and [26, Theorem 8.1
and Remark 8.4] (see also [24] and Section 5). Therefore, by Theorem 1.3, there exists an
infinitely divisible distribution corresponding to gH1(t) under the Riemann hypothesis.

Theorem 1.4. We assume the Riemann hypothesis and the linear independence over
rationals for the set of positive imaginary parts of the nontrivial zeros of ζ(s). Let
MH1(w) be the M -function in the analog of Theorem 1.1 for H1(X) (Corollary 2.1 and
Theorem 3.1 below). For y > 0, let µy(x) be the infinitely divisible distribution on R
whose characteristic function is exp(ygH1(t)):

exp(ygH1(t)) =

(cid:90) ∞

−∞

eitxµy(dx).

Then the value of the point mass of µy(x) at the origin is given by the M -function as
follows:

µy({0}) = e−yH1(1) (cid:103)MH1(−iy) = e−yH1(1) (cid:89)

the product (cid:81)
γ>0 ranges over all positive imaginary parts γ of nontrivial zeros of ζ(s)
without multiplicity, mγ is the multiplicity of the nontrivial zero 1/2 + iγ, and J0(z) is
the Bessel function of the first kind of order zero.

This is a special case of Theorem 5.1. We do not know what equation (1.8) can be
applied to, but it is interesting in its own right, because, in general, it is difficult to
calculate values of the corresponding infinitely divisible distribution for a given screw
function (or a L´evy measure).

In the following sections, we prove Theorems 1.1 to 1.4 in more general settings

including the series

Hℓ(X) :=

X ρ−1/2
(ρ − ℓ)((1 − ρ) − ℓ)

(cid:88)

ρ

, X ≥ 1,

ℓ ∈ R,

(1.9)

where the sum is taken with multiplicity. The series Hℓ(X) is nothing but (1.5) when
ℓ = 1, and is real-valued by the same reasoning as (1.1). The difference H1/2(et)−H1/2(1)
becomes the screw function of ζ(s) studied in [27] (see the comments after Proposition
6.3). The reason why we proceed with the discussion in general settings is to show that
the value distributions of absolutely convergent oscillatory sums such as (1.1), (1.5),
and (1.9) can be discussed regardless of the specific form of the coefficients. As a result,
such a theory can not only be applied to the sums replacing the nontrivial zeros of
the Riemann zeta-function with those of Dedekind zeta-functions or automorphic L-
functions in (1.1), (1.5), and (1.9), but also to sums of different analytic nature, such
as

(cid:88)

(1.10)

which appears in a formula of Ramanujan, and whose convergence is more delicate
compared to (1.1) and (1.5). The conditional convergence of (1.10) is discussed in
Titchmarsh [28, pp. 219–220]. Chirre and Gonek [5] proved that (1.10) converges
absolutely under what they named the “Weak Mertens Hypothesis”, and studied its
value distribution under the linear independence over rationals for the set of positive
imaginary parts of the nontrivial zeros of ζ(s).

The results mentioned in the introduction are proved in the following sections as
special cases of the general theorems. In Sections 2 and 3 we study M -functions. In
Section 2, we set up an axiomatic framework that includes H(X) and Hℓ(X) and prove
formulas for M -functions (Theorem 2.1) as a generalization of Theorem 1.1. In Section
3, we prove Theorem 3.1, which includes Theorem 1.2 and can be viewed as the converse
of Theorem 2.1, with one additional condition to the setting in Section 2. In Sections 4

M -FUNCTIONS AND SCREW FUNCTIONS

5

and 5, we study screw functions by adding a few conditions to the axioms in Sections 2
and 3. Theorem 1.3 is proven as a special case of Corollary 4.1 in Section 4. Theorem
1.4 is proven as a special case of Theorem 5.1 in Section 5. Furthermore, we additionally
provide explicit formulas for H(X) and Hℓ(X) that do not include nontrivial zeros of
ζ(s) in their expressions in Section 6. Finally, we explain the equivalence of (1.2) and
(1.6) under the Riemann hypothesis in Section 7.

2. The axiomatic framework

2.1. Generalization of Theorem 1.1. We prove Theorem 1.1 as a special case of the
following general cases. Let Π = (Ω, a) be a pair of a countable set of nonzero complex
numbers Ω with #Ω ≥ 5 and a function a : Ω → C \ {0} satisfying the following two
conditions:
(M1) (cid:80)
(M2) There exists c ≥ 0 such that |ℑ(ω)| ≤ c for every ω ∈ Ω.

ω∈Ω |a(ω)| converges.

The reason why zero is excluded from Ω is that it is meaningless in (3.1) below, and it is
inconvenient when considering the linear independence of Ω. Also, the reason why the
function a is assumed to be nonzero is that the proof of Proposition 4.1 below works.

Clearly, Ω ⊂ R implies (M2). Furthermore, we denote by LIC(Ω) the assertion
that the set Ω is linearly independent over the rationals. The importance of linear
independence in the theory of value-distribution of ζ(s) was probably first pointed out
by Wintner [29].

The pair of the set

Ω+

ζ := {ω = i(ρ − 1/2) | ζ(ρ) = 0, 0 < ℜ(ρ) < 1, ℑ(ρ) > 0},

(2.1)

(ρ = 1/2 − iω, ω ∈ Ω ⊂ C) and either

aH (ω) : =

2mω
(1/2 − iω)(3/2 − iω)

or

aHℓ(ω) : =

2mω
(1/2 − iω − ℓ)(1/2 + iω − ℓ)

is an example of pairs satisfying (M1) and (M2), where mω is the multiplicity of the
nontrivial zero ρ = 1/2 − iω of ζ(s). Note that the claim LIC(Ω+
ζ ) is different from the
usual linear independence of the nontrivial zeros of ζ(s), which implies the simplicity
of the zeros. As can be seen from the proof of [22, Proposition 4.1] together with [22,
(3.1)], LIC in [22, Theorem 2.3] is used in the latter sense. On the other hand, LIC(Ω+
ζ )
does not imply the simplicity of nontrivial zeros, since it excludes information about the
multiplicities of the nontrivial zeros.

For a pair satisfying (M1) and (M2), we define

fΠ(t) :=

(cid:88)

a(ω)e−itω.

(2.2)

ω∈Ω
Theorem 2.1. Let Π = (Ω, a) be a pair satisfying (M1). We assume Ω ⊂ R and

|a(ω)|

,

(cid:88)

ω∈Ω

(2.8)

and the equality holds in (2.8) if Π satisfies (2.5).

Proof. Applying (2.3) to Φ(w) = ψz(w) = exp(iℜ(¯zw)) for z ∈ R,

This implies (2.7) for Φ(w) = ψz(w). Then, formula (2.7) about general locally Riemann
□
integrable functions Φ follows from arguments similar to those in [22, Section 6].

Theorem 1.1 is obtained as MH (u) = M ℜ
ζ , aH ), since

where mρ := mω if ρ = 1/2 − iω (cf. (2.1)).
In particular, the compactness of the
support of MH (u) follows from (2.8), i.e., from the boundedness of H(X). The analog
of Theorem 1.1 for Hℓ(X) (ℓ ∈ R) is obtained by applying Corollary 2.1 to Π = (Ω+
ζ , aHℓ)
as well. See Section 2.3 for the confirmation that condition (2.5) is satisfied in these
cases. If we take the pair of

Ωℑ,+
ζ

:= {−ℑ(ρ) | ζ(ρ) = 0, 0 < ℜ(ρ) < 1, ℑ(ρ) > 0}

and aH , the analog of Theorem 1.1 for Ψ(X) in [22, (1.2)] is obtained.

2.2. Proof of Theorem 2.1. Theorem 2.1 is proved by almost the same argument as
in the proof of [22, Theorem 2.3] under the assumptions (M1), Ω ⊂ R, and the LIC(Ω).
Therefore, we only describe the outline of the proof.

Let cω = |a(ω)| and βω = arg a(ω). Then,

f (t) := fΠ(t) =

cω e−i(tω−βω).

(cid:88)

ω∈Ω

We first consider the finite truncation

fN (t) =

(cid:88)

|ω|≤N

cω e−i(tω−βω)

(N ∈ Z>0).

Let T be the unit circle on C, and TN = (cid:81)

SN (tN ) =

T. Define

cω tω,

|ω|≤N
(cid:88)

|ω|≤N

where tN = (tω)|ω|≤N ∈ TN . Then obviously

(2.9)

fN (t) = SN ((e−i(tω−βω))|ω|≤N ).
These fN (t) and SN (tN ) are analogs of (3.3) and (3.4) in [22], respectively, but differ in
that ω are not subscripted. For example, in [22], fN (t) consists of N terms, but fN (t)
above consists of all terms of ω that satisfy |ω| ≤ N .
Proposition 2.1. We may construct a function MN : C → R≥0, for which

(2.10)

(cid:90)

C

MN (w)Φ(w)|dw| =

(cid:90)

TN

Φ(SN (tN ))d∗tN

holds for any continuous function Φ on C, where |dw| = dudv/(2π) for w = u + iv
and d∗tN is the normalized Haar measure on TN , that is the product measure of d∗t =
dθ/(2π) for t = eiθ ∈ T. In particular, we obtain

(cid:90)

C

MN (w)|dw| = 1.

Also, if two or more ω’s satisfy |ω| ≤ N , the function MN (w) is compactly supported,
nonnegative, and MN ( ¯w) = MN (w). Moreover, if five or more ω’s satisfy |ω| ≤ N ,
MN (w) is continuous.

This is shown by the same argument as in the proof of [22, Proposition 3.1]. The
condition that there are two or more (resp. five or more) ω’s that satisfy |ω| ≤ N
corresponds to the condition N ≥ 2 (resp. N ≥ 5) in [22, Proposition 3.1] due to the
difference in the definitions of fN (t) and SN (tN ). The function MN (w) is constructed
as a multiple convolution of

mω(w) =

1
r

δ(r − cω), w = reiθ ∈ C, r = |w|, θ = arg w

for |ω| ≤ N , where δ(·) stands for the Dirac delta distribution. In particular,

|w| ≤

(2.11)

if five or more ω’s satisfy |ω| ≤ N . The inclusion follows from the fact that the support
of MΠ coincides with the image of SN (tN ) (cf. [22, Proposition 3.4]). From this fact, we
find that (2.11) holds in general by considering definition (2.9) geometrically. Moreover,
the equality holds in (2.11) if

(2.12)

K. MATSUMOTO AND M. SUZUKI

This can be shown as follows. (This type of argument originates from Bohr; see [4,
Hilfssatz 1].) Assume that max|ω|≤N cω is attained by ω = ω1, and N is large enough to
be |ω1| ≤ N . When tω1 runs over T, the set of all cω1tω1 forms a circle C1 whose center
is the origin and the radius is cω1. For any other ω2 with |ω2| ≤ N , the set

{cω1tω1 + cω2tω2 | tω1, tω2 ∈ T}
is an annulus with inner radius cω1 − cω2 and outer radius cω1 + cω2. By adding a
third ω3, we obtain a larger annulus, with inner radius cω1 − cω2 − cω3 and outer radius
cω1 + cω2 + cω3. Repeating this procedure, we find that the interior of the circle C1 is
completely included in the image of SN if condition (2.12) is satisfied and N is sufficiently
large, and hence the equality holds in (2.11).

By assumptions Ω ⊂ R and the LIC(Ω), the following holds by the same argument as

in the proof of [22, Proposition 4.2].

We have

(2.13)
(cid:101)mω(z) = J0(cω|z|)
by [22, Remark 5.1]. As stated there, this is originally due to Jessen and Wintner [18,
Section 5] and Ihara [15, Section 3.1]. If we define

(cid:102)MN (z) :=

(cid:89)

|ω|≤N

(cid:101)mω(z),

(2.14)

then (cid:102)MN (z) converges to (cid:102)M (z) uniformly in C as N → ∞. The limit function (cid:103)MΠ(z) :=
(cid:102)M (z) is continuous and belongs to Lp (for any p ∈ [1, ∞]), and the above convergence
is also Lp-convergence. The proof of these facts is the same with the proof of [22,
Proposition 5.5], because it is applied by (M1) and the definition of fN (t). Now define

MΠ(w) :=

(cid:90)

C

(cid:103)MΠ(z)ψ−w(z)|dz|.

Then we obtain the following by the same argument as in the proof of [22, Proposition
5.6] and (2.11).
Proposition 2.3. When N → ∞, MN (w) converges to MΠ(w) uniformly in w ∈ C.
The limit function MΠ(w) is continuous, nonnegative, compactly supported, MΠ( ¯w) =
MΠ(w), and

(cid:90)

MΠ(w)|dw| = 1.

that satisfy 0 < ℑ(ρ) < 35 from a well-known numerical table. We order these zeros
so that their imaginary parts increase, and denote them by ρn = 1/2 − iωn (ωn ∈ R<0,

3. A condition for Ω to be a subset of R

For a pair Π = (Ω, a) satisfying (M1) and (M2), we define

gΠ(t) := fΠ(t) − fΠ(0) =

(cid:88)

ω∈Ω

a(ω)(e−itω − 1)

(3.1)

for real t. The function gΠ(t) is a continuous function on the real line with gΠ(0) = 0,
because the series on the right-hand side of (3.1) converges absolutely and uniformly on
any finite closed interval of R by (M1) and (M2).

Proposition 3.1. Let Π = (Ω, a) be a pair satisfying (M1) and (M2). Then, the real
part ℜ(gΠ(t)) is bounded on [0, ∞) if and only if Ω is a subset of the closed lower half-
plane C \ C+ = {z | ℑ(z) ≤ 0}.
Proof. If Ω ⊂ C \ C+, the function gΠ(t) is obviously bounded on [0, ∞) by definition
(3.1). Therefore, ℜ(gΠ(t)) is also bounded on [0, ∞). To show the converse, we consider
the Fourier transform of ℜ(gΠ(t))1≥0(t). By the integral formula

we obtain

and c ≥ 0 is the constant in (M2). By definition and (M2), QΠ(z) is meromorphic on C
and holomorphic on C \ (Ω ∪ (−Ω)).

Suppose that ℜ(gΠ(t)) is bounded on [0, ∞). Then, the left-hand side of (3.2)
converges absolutely and uniformly on any compact subset in the upper half-plane
C+ = {z | ℑ(z) > 0}. Therefore, QΠ(z) is holomorphic in C+. However, if Ω has an
element in C+, it must be a pole of QΠ(z), since a(ω) ̸= 0 for every ω ∈ Ω by definition.
□
This is a contradiction. Hence, Ω ⊂ C \ C+ if ℜ(gΠ(t)) is bounded on [0, ∞).

To prove an extension of Theorem 1.2 under the general setting in Section 2.1, we

add the following third condition.

ζ , aH1), because, if ρ = 1/2 − iω

ζ , aH ) and (Ω+

Due to the symmetry of Ω in (M3), the following result immediately follows from

Proposition 3.1.

Corollary 3.1. Let Π = (Ω, a) be a pair satisfying (M1), (M2), and (M3). Then, the
real part ℜ(gΠ(t)) is bounded on [0, ∞) if and only if Ω is a subset of R.
Remark 3.1. In Corollary 3.1, if ℜ(gΠ(t)) is bounded on [0, ∞), then Ω ⊂ R, which
implies that ℜ(gΠ(t)) is bounded on R by (3.1). Therefore, [0, ∞) in Corollary 3.1 can
be replaced by R, but the behavior of ℜ(gΠ(t)) on (−∞, 0) is not necessary below.

Using Corollary 3.1, we obtain the following result.

Theorem 3.1. Let Π = (Ω, a) be a pair satisfying (M1), (M2), and (M3). We assume
that equality (2.7) holds for any test function Φ : R → C which is locally Riemann
integrable. Then Ω is a subset of R.

Proof. By Corollary 3.1, it is sufficient to prove that ℜ(fΠ(t)) is bounded on [0, ∞) if
(2.7) holds for any locally Riemann integrable function Φ. We prove the boundedness of
ℜ(fΠ(t)) on [0, ∞) by contradiction. We denote |ℜ(fΠ(t))| by F (t) for simplicity. First,
we note that there exists R > 0 such that

supp M ℜ

Π ⊂ {u ∈ R : |u| ≤ R},

since the support of M ℜ
unbounded on [0, ∞). Then, there exists t1 > 0 that satisfies

Π (u) is compact by Corollary 2.1. We assume that F (t) (≥ 0) is

F (t1) > R + 1

and t1 > R + 1.

For this, we write a1 = F (t1). Subsequently, again from the unboundedness, there exists
t2 > t1 + 2 that satisfies F (t2) > a1 + 2. For this, we write a2 = F (t2). By repeating
the above process, we obtain sequences {tn}n≥1 and {an}n≥1 that satisfy an = F (tn),

tn+1 > tn + 2,

and an+1 = F (tn+1) > an + 2.

By definition, these two sequences are strictly monotonically increasing.

For each tn, there exists 0 < δn < 1 such that |t − tn| < δn implies |F (t) − an| < 1
by the continuity of F (t). Note that no t ∈ R satisfies |t − tn| < 1 for two different n
simultaneously, because tn+1 > tn + 2.

Now we define the test function (cid:101)Φ by

(cid:101)Φ(u) :=






tn
δn
0

if |u − an| < 1,

otherwise.

This (cid:101)Φ is clearly a Riemann integrable function, with the support

∞
(cid:91)

[an − 1, an + 1].

n=1

Note that no u ∈ R satisfies |u − an| < 1 for two different n simultaneously, because
an+1 > an + 2 by definition.

For the test function Φ(u) := (cid:101)Φ(|u|), the value of the right-hand side of (2.7) is zero,
since the support of Φ is contained in {u > R} by a1 − 1 = F (t1) − 1 > R + 1 − 1, and
M ℜ
Π (u) = 0 if u > R. However, the value of the left-hand side of (2.7) is not zero as
follows.

12

K. MATSUMOTO AND M. SUZUKI

By definition of δn, if |t−tn| < δn, then |F (t)−an| < 1, and therefore (cid:101)Φ(F (t)) = tn/δn.

ζ , aH1).

The (obvious) analog of Theorem 1.2 for H1(X) is obtained by applying Theorem
3.1 to (Ω+
(cf. The comment after Corollary 2.1 at the end of Section 2.1.)
Furthermore, the following result is also proven by replacing ℜ(fΠ(t)), M ℜ
Π (u), and
(cid:101)Φ(|u|) (u ∈ R) with fΠ(t), MΠ(w), and (cid:101)Φ(|w|) (w ∈ C), respectively, in the proof of
Theorem 3.1.

Theorem 3.2. Let Π = (Ω, a) be a pair satisfying (M1), (M2), and (M3). We assume
that equality (2.3) holds for any test function Φ : C → C which is locally Riemann
integrable. Then fΠ(t) is bounded on [0, ∞).

4. A class of screw functions

To relate the functions (2.2) attached to pairs Π = (Ω, a) with screw functions, we

consider the following conditions:

(S1) a(¯ω) = a(ω) for any ω ∈ Ω,
(S2) Ω ⊂ R and a(ω) > 0 for all ω ∈ Ω.

The former is a weaker condition than the latter, since (S2) implies (S1). The pairs
(Ω+
ζ , aHℓ) satisfy (S1) unconditionally and (S2) under the Riemann hypothesis. The
pair (Ω+
ζ , aH ) satisfies neither (S1) nor (S2) even if assuming the Riemann hypothesis.
We have already noted that (M1) and (M2) imply the continuity of gΠ(t) and gΠ(0) = 0,
but if we assume (M3) and (S1) in addition, gΠ(t) satisfies

gΠ(−t) = gΠ(t).

(4.1)

Proposition 4.1. Let Π = (Ω, a) be a pair satisfying (M1), (M2), (M3), and (S1).
Then, gΠ(t) defined in (3.1) is a screw function on R if and only if Π satisfies (S2).

Proof. First, we prove that gΠ(t) is a screw function if Π satisfies (S2). It suffices to
show that Gg(t, u) is nonnegative definite on R, since we already confirm (4.1). We have

Gg(t, u) =

for any n ∈ Z>0, ti ∈ R and ξi ∈ C by (S2). Hence, Gg(t, u) is nonnegative definite on
R.

Conversely, we suppose that gΠ(t) is a screw function on R. We define the function

Q(z) by using the right Fourier integral as

(cid:90) ∞

0

gΠ(t) eizt dt = −

i
z2 Q(z).

By (M1), (M2), and (3.1), the left-hand side is integrated term by term, defining a
holomorphic function on ℑ(z) > c such that
(cid:88)

Q(z) =

a(ω)

ω∈Ω

−zω
z − ω

holds. Furthermore, the assumption implies that Q(z) extends to a holomorphic function
defined on C+ mapping C+ into C+ ∪ R by [19, Satz 5.9]. Hence, Ω ⊂ R is shown in
the same way as in the proof of Proposition 3.1 and Corollary 3.1. By the definition of
screw functions, Gg(t, u) must be nonnegative definite, which implies that a(ω) > 0 for
□
all ω ∈ Ω by (4.2).

Applying Proposition 4.1 to Ω = Ω+

ζ ∪ (−Ω+

ζ ) and a = 1

2 aHℓ, we obtain the following,

where the right-hand side of a is an obvious extension to Ω.

Corollary 4.1. The function

gHℓ(t) := Hℓ(et) − Hℓ(1)
is a screw function on R if and only if the Riemann hypothesis holds. In particular,
Theorem 1.3 holds.

5. A point mass formula at the origin for
infinitely divisible distributions

In this section we discuss the connection between the M -functions and the theory of
infinitely divisible distributions, with the aid of screw functions. First, we review the
following result:

Proposition 5.1. For a function h(t) on R, exp(h(t)) is the characteristic function of
an infinitely divisible distribution µ on R: exp(h(t)) = (cid:82) ∞

If the measure ν in (5.1) satisfies (cid:82)

case of R, and the second half is obtained by applying [26, (8.7)] to the case of R. □

Using Proposition 5.1, we obtain:

14

K. MATSUMOTO AND M. SUZUKI

Proposition 5.2. Let Π = (Ω, a) be a pair satisfying (M1) and (S2). Then, for any
y > 0, there exists an infinitely divisible distribution µΠ,y(x) on R whose characteristic
function is exp(yℜ(gΠ(t))), that is,

exp(yℜ(gΠ(t))) =

(cid:90)

R

eitxµΠ,y(dx).

(5.3)

Proof. First, we note that Π = (Ω, a) satisfies (M1), (M2), (M3), (S1), and (S2) because
(M2), (M3), and (S1) follow from (S2). For any y > 0, yℜ(gΠ(t)) is a real-valued screw
function satisfying yℜ(gΠ(0)) = 0 and fΠ(0) > 0 by assumptions, (3.1), and Proposition
4.1. Therefore, yℜ(gΠ(t)) has the form (5.1) with A = 0 by [20, Theorem 5.1]. Then, for
any y > 0, there exists an infinitely divisible distribution µΠ,y(x) such that (5.3) holds
□
by Proposition 5.1.

Remark 5.1. In the proof of Proposition 5.2, we referred to [20, Theorem 5.1] to prove
(5.3), but if we use (5.2) based on (3.1), the result in [20] is not necessary. Such an
argument is similar to that made in [24, Proof of (1)⇒(2) in Theorem 1.1]. However, in
order to clarify the relation between screw functions and infinitely divisible distributions
for the readers, we provided a proof using [20].

Theorem 1.4 is obtained by applying the following result to Π = (Ω+

ζ , aH1) under the

Riemann hypothesis and LIC(Ω+

ζ ) since H1(et) = ℜ(fΠ(t)).

Theorem 5.1. Let Π = (Ω, a) be a pair satisfying (M1) and (S2). We assume LIC(Ω).
For y > 0, let µΠ,y(x) be the infinitely divisible distribution in Proposition 5.2, and let
M ℜ
Π (u) be the M -function in Corollary 2.1. Then the value of the point mass of µΠ,y(x)
at the origin is given by the M -function as follows:

µΠ,y({0}) = exp(−y fΠ(0))(cid:103)M ℜ

Π (−iy) = exp(−y fΠ(0))

by (2.6), because the power series expansion of J0(x) at the origin consists of even powers
of x. The left-hand side of (5.5) is the definition of (cid:103)M ℜ
Π (z) for real z and extends to
z ∈ C by the compactness of the support of M ℜ
Π (u) in Corollary 2.1. The right-hand
side of (5.5) also extends to z ∈ C, because J0(x) = 1 + O(|x|) as |x| → 0. Hence,

6. Explicit formulas for H(X) and Hℓ(X)

The boundedness of the series H(X) and H1(X) can be observed without using the
information about the nontrivial zeros, at least numerically, by the following formulas
(Proposition 6.1). As seen in the proof, they are obtained by just combining classical
results [6, Section 17, (1)], [13, (2.6)], and [17, p. 81]. Also, (6.1) below is essentially
the same as Fujii’s (1.3), which is obtained by integrating formula (6.5). Similarly, (6.2)
below is essentially a special case of Ihara, Murty, and Shimura [16, Theorem 1]. In this
sense, these two formulas are not new. However, the formula for H1(X) is extended to
the more general cases of Hℓ(X) (Propositions 6.2 and 6.3). This provides an alternative
proof of [27, Theorem 1.1 (2)], which is used to establish several key results in [27].

Furthermore, formulas (6.1) and (6.2) hold for X = 1 in the sense that the right limits
of the right-hand sides at X = 1 are equal to the values of the left-hand sides at X = 1.

obtain (6.2) for X > 1.

By definition (1.1) (resp.

(6.2)) is right
continuous at X = 1. On the other hand, the right-hand side of (6.1) (resp. (6.2)) has
the right limit at X = 1, because

(6.9), we get (6.8) for X > 1 since ℓ ̸= −2n, 0, 1/2, 1, 2n + 1 (n ∈ Z>0).

By definition (1.9), the left-hand side of (6.8) is right continuous at X = 1. On the

other hand, the right-hand side of (6.8) has the right limit at X = 1, because

symmetry of nontrivial zeros for ρ (cid:55)→ 1 − ρ. Therefore, [27, Theorem 1.1 (2)] is proved.

7. On the equivalence of (1.2) and (1.6)

We show the equivalence of (1.2) and (1.6) assuming the Riemann hypothesis. First,
