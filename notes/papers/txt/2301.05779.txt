LI COEFFICIENTS AS NORMS OF FUNCTIONS
IN A MODEL SPACE

MASATOSHI SUZUKI

Abstract. It is known that the nonnegativity of Li coeﬃcients is a necessary and
suﬃcient condition for the Riemann hypothesis. We show that it is a necessary and
suﬃcient condition for the Riemann hypothesis that all Li coeﬃcients are norms of
certain concrete functions on the real line. Such conditional formulas for Li coeﬃcients
are understood as a kind of Weil’s criterion for the Riemann hypothesis.

1. Introduction and the result

Li’s criterion [8, Theorem 1] obtained by Xian-Jin Li asserts that the Riemann hy-

pothesis holds if and only if the Li coeﬃcients deﬁned by

are nonnegative for all positive integers n, where ρ runs over all nontrivial zeros of
the Riemann zeta function ζ(s) counting multiplicity and the sum is understood as
|ℑ(ρ)|≤T . The nonnegativity of λn follows easily from the Riemann

E. Bombieri and J. C. Lagarias [2] pointed out that the nonnegativity of λn follows

from the nonnegativity of the Weil distribution W deﬁned by

certain functions themselves closely related to the nonnegativity of λn.

The Riemann hypothesis follows trivially from equation (1.8) by Li’s criterion. There-
fore, the nontrivial part of Theorem 1.1 is that the validity of equation (1.8) is a nec-
essary condition. In contrast, the validity of equation (1.3) is unconditional, but the
nonnegativity of the right-hand side is highly nontrivial.

If we assume the Riemann hypothesis, Gn(z) are vectors in a model space

(Θ) in the
upper half-plane generated by a meromorphic inner function Θ, as shown in the proof
of Theorem 1.1 below. The title of this paper derives from this fact.

K

Although precise deﬁnitions and related notions are deferred to Section 3.1, we should
mention that model spaces are important subjects in analysis. They are deﬁned as
orthogonal complements of shift-invariant closed subspaces of the Hardy space and are
relevant to many aspects of functional, complex, and harmonic analysis as presented in
the survey of Garcia–Ross [4] (see also the book of Garcia–Mashreghi–Ross [5]). Among
the model spaces in the upper-half plane, those generated by the meromorphic inner
functions have extra importance in their relation with the de Branges spaces, which are
nice Hilbert spaces consisting of entire functions. The above meromorphic inner function

by [2, p. 282, Remark] and η0 =
γ0 in [2, p. 286, formula below (4.3)]. The reason
for the above observation lies in a direct relation between Gn(z) and gn(x) under the
Riemann hypothesis by the framework of [12], and equation (1.8) expresses that relation
via (1.3). Since this is the direct background of Theorem 1.1, we give some details in
Section 4.2. Other meanings or characterizations of Gn(z) are interesting but unknown
at present.

Theorem 1.1 is proved in Section 3 using results in Section 2 and the theory of model
spaces reviewed in Section 3.1. The strategy of the proof of Theorem 1.1 is similar to
[11], however the computational details change. The core of the proof is Proposition 2.1,
which is unconditional, and Proposition 3.2, which holds under the Riemann hypothesis.

2. Preliminaries

2.1. Two unconditional propositions. We denote by
the set of all distinct zeros

Proposition 2.3. Functions Hn(s) deﬁned in (1.6) have the following properties.
(1) Hn(s) are meromorphic functions on C taking real values on the real line.
(2) Hn(s) are neither real nor purely imaginary valued on the line

(s) = 1/2 in

ℜ

general.

The zeros of ξ(s) + ξ′(s) are classiﬁed into those originating from multiple zeros of

ξ(s) and those not. It is this latter category that appears as poles of Hn(s).

(3) Hn(s) are analytic in C except for points λ such that ξ(λ)+ ξ′(λ) = 0 and λ

In particular, s = 0 and s = 1 are not poles of Hn(s).

6∈ Z
(4) If λ is an zero of ξ(s) + ξ′(s) of order m and a zero of Mn(s) of order less than
m, then it is a pole of Hn(s). That is, the locations of possible poles of Hn(s)
are independent of n, but whether or not they are actual poles and their order
depend on n.

.

(5) The set of zeros of ξ(s) + ξ′(s) and the set of poles of Hn(s) are closed under

complex conjugation.

Proof. The ﬁrst half of (1) follows from Lemma 2.1 and Proposition 2.1, and the second
half is trivial by deﬁnition (1.6). Formula (1.10) shows that H1(s) is neither real nor
(s) = 1/2, since (ξ′/ξ)(s) takes non-constant pure
purely imaginary valued on the line
imaginary values on
(s) = 1/2. Hence, (2) holds. From Lemma 2.1 and Proposition
2.1, Hn(s) has no poles other than the zeros of ξ(s) and ξ(s) + ξ′(s). Furthermore, from
the proof of Proposition 2.2, Hn(s) has no poles at the zeros of ξ(s). Hence, (3) holds.
Moreover, (4) holds by (2.2). Since ξ(s) + ξ′(s) and Hn(s) are real valued on the real
(cid:3)
line, (5) holds.

3. Proof of Theorem 1.1

3.1. Model spaces and related notions. To prove Theorem 1.1, we need the theory
of model spaces in the upper half-plane. Therefore, we ﬁrst brieﬂy review the notions
related to model spaces in the upper half-plane according to Garcia–Ross [4, Section
10], Makarov–Poltoratski [9, Section 1.2], and Havin–Mashreghi [6, Section 2]. (See also

Proposition 3.1. Let E(z) and Θ(z) be functions deﬁned in (3.1) and (3.2), respec-
tively. Then the following are equivalent:
(1) The Riemann hypothesis holds;
(2) E(z) belongs to the Hermite–Biehler class;
(3) Θ(z) is a meromorphic inner function for C+.

Proof. (1) and (2) are equivalent by [7, Theorem 1]. The implication of (2) to (3) is
immediate. This is because Θ(z) has norm one on the real axis, is analytic in C+, and
is bounded in the upper half-plane, which makes it an inner function. We prove that
C+. If
(3) implies (2) by contradiction. Note that (3) implies

(2) is false, then (1) is also false, so ξ(1/2

We comment on the direct relation between (1) and (3). The function Θ(z) in (3.2)
is unconditionally meromorphic on C and unconditionally takes absolute value one ev-
erywhere on the real axis by deﬁnition. Therefore, it is an meromorphic inner function
if it is analytic in C+. The Riemann hypothesis is used to prove it has no poles in the
upper half-plane.

4. Concluding remarks

4.1. On a relation between λn and Gn. It is an interesting question what can be said
about the relation between Li coeﬃcients λn and functions Gn either unconditionally or
when the Riemann hypothesis is false. However, it is diﬃcult to say anything concrete
about the relation between λn and Gn in such a situation. For example, equation

λ1 =

(4.1)

for n = 1 is a necessary condition for the truth of the Riemann hypothesis. In this case,
λ1 and H1(s) can be written down in simple form as (1.11) and (1.10), respectively, so
(4.1) can in principle be conﬁrmed with arbitrary precision by numerical calculations.
However, the author could not ﬁnd a way to theoretically conﬁrm (4.1).

The main obstacle is that integrals

trying to calculate these integrals by moving the path of integration and residue calculus,
it becomes necessary to deal with the zeros of ξ(s) + ξ′(s) whose relation to the zeros of

two reasons, it is considered to be diﬃcult to derive some results on the norm of Gn(z)
unconditionally or under the assumption that the Riemann hypothesis is false, and new
and fundamental ideas are needed.
