Hochschild homology, trace map and ζ-cycles

Alain Connes and Caterina Consani

Abstract. In this paper we consider two spectral realizations of the zeros of
the Riemann zeta function. The ﬁrst one involves all non-trivial (i.e. non-real)
zeros and is expressed in terms of a Laplacian intimately related to the prolate
wave operator. The second spectral realization aﬀects only the critical zeros
and it is cast in terms of sheaf cohomology. The novelty is that the base space
is the Scaling Site playing the role of the parameter space for the ζ-cycles and
encoding their stability by coverings.

1. Introduction

In this paper we give a Hochschild homological interpretation of the zeros of
the Riemann zeta function. The root of this result is in the recognition that the
map

which is deﬁned on a suitable subspace of the linear space of complex-valued even
Schwartz functions on the real line, is a trace in Hochschild homology, if one brings
AQ from the rational ad`eles to
in the construction the projection π : AQ
the ad`ele classes (see Section 3).
In this paper, we shall consider two spectral
realizations of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The ﬁrst one involves all
non-trivial (i.e. non-real) zeros and is expressed in terms of a Laplacian intimately
related to the prolate wave operator (see Section 4). The second spectral realization
is sharper inasmuch as it aﬀects only the critical zeros. The main players are
here the ζ-cycles introduced in [7], and the Scaling Site [6] as their parameter
space, which encodes their stability by coverings. The ζ-cycles give the theoretical
geometric explanation for the striking coincidence between the low lying spectrum
of a perturbed spectral triple therein introduced (see [7]), and the low lying (critical)
zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The deﬁnition of a ζ-cycle derives, as a by-
product, from scale-invariant Riemann sums for complex-valued functions on the
Rą1, one implements the
real half-line

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 recalls the main role played by
the (image of the) map E in the study of the spectral realization of the critical
zeros of the Riemann zeta function. In Section 3 we show the identiﬁcation of the
Hochschild homology HH0 of the noncommutative space Qˆ
AQ with the coinvari-
ants for the action of Qˆ on the Schwartz algebra, using the (so-called) “wrong
way” functoriality map π! associated to the projection π : AQ
AQ. We also
stress the relevant fact that the Fourier transform on ad`eles becomes canonical after
passing to HH0 of the ad`ele class space of the rationals. The key Proposition 3.3
describes the invariant part of such HH0 as the space of even Schwartz functions
on the real line and identiﬁes the trace map with the map E. Section 4 takes care
of the two vanishing conditions implemented in the deﬁnition of E and introduces
(H being the generator of the scaling action of R˚
the operator ∆
`
ev) playing the role of the Laplacian and intimately related to the prolate
on S
q
operator. Finally, Section 5 is the main technical section of this paper since it
contains the proof of Theorem 1.2.

2. The map E and the zeros of the zeta function

The ad`ele class space of the rationals Qˆ

AQ is the natural geometric framework
to understand the Riemann-Weil explicit formulas for L-functions as a trace formula
[3]. The essence of this result lies mainly in the delicate computation of the principal
values involved in the distributions appearing in the geometric (right-hand) side of
the semi-local trace formula of op.cit. (see Theorem 4 for the notations)

which may help one to realize how the sum over the zeros of the zeta function ap-
pears. Here this relation is simply explained. Given a complex valued polynomial
P
, one may identify the set of its zeros as the spectrum of the endo-
morphism T of multiplication by the variable x computed in the quotient algebra
C
. It is well known that the matrix of T , in the basis of powers of x,
is the companion matrix of P
x
. Furthermore, the trace of its powers, readily

In this section we continue the study of the map E with the goal to achieve a
geometric understanding of it. This is obtained by bringing in the construction the
ad`ele class space of the rationals, whose role is that to grant for the replacement,
in (2.1), of the summation over the monoid Nˆ with the summation over the group
Qˆ. Then, up to the factor u1{2, E is understood as the composite ι˚

Remark 4.4. The main interest of the above reformulation of the spectral

related to the prolate wave operator Wλ that is shown in [10] to be self-adjoint

relation between ∆ and Wλ is that the latter is a perturbation of ∆ by a multiple
of the Harmonic oscillator.

. To construct f˘ one considers the sheaf G˘ which
of the function ζ
is the quotient of the sheaf of C8
functions by the closure of the ideal
`
˘
subsheaf generated by the multiples of the function ζ
. Since the latter is
a module over the sheaf of C8 functions, it is a ﬁne sheaf, thus a global section
of G˘ can be lifted to a function. By Proposition 5.2 (v), the Fourier components
of local sections ξj of L2 representing ξ deﬁne a global section of G˘. The
ξj
q
functions f˘ are obtained by lifting these sections. By appealing to Lemma 5.3, we

let φ

p

we show that q

are the same. Thus it is enough to show that given L0

q
of ξ in a small open interval U containing L0, the diﬀerence δ
ξ0 is a section of
ΣE. Again by Proposition 5.2 (v), it suﬃces to show that the Fourier components

p
Nˆ-invariance of ξ shows that F

by the deﬁning properties of the functions f˘ one has
