Abstract We exhibit very small eigenvalues of the quadratic form associated to the Weil explicit formulas
restricted to test functions whose support is within a ﬁxed interval with upper bound S. We show
both numerically and conceptually that the associated eigenvectors are obtained by a simple arithmetic
operation of ﬁnite sum using prolate spheroidal wave functions associated to the scale S. Then we use
these functions to condition the canonical spectral triple of the circle of length L=2 Log(S) in such a
way that they belong to the kernel of the perturbed Dirac operator. We give numerical evidence that,
when one varies L, the low lying spectrum of the perturbed spectral triple resembles the low lying zeros
of the Riemann zeta function. We justify conceptually this result and show that, for each eigenvalue, the
coincidence is perfect for the special values of the length L of the circle for which the two natural ways of
realizing the perturbation give the same eigenvalue. This fact is tested numerically by reproducing the
ﬁrst thirty one zeros of the Riemann zeta function from our spectral side, and estimate the probability
of having obtained this agreement at random, as a very small number whose ﬁrst ﬁfty decimal places are
all zero. The theoretical concept which emerges is that of zeta cycle and our main result establishes its
relation with the critical zeros of the Riemann zeta function and with the spectral realization of these
zeros obtained by the ﬁrst author.

1. Introduction

When contemplating the low lying zeros of the Riemann zeta function one is tempted
to speculate that they may form the spectrum of an operator of the form 1
2 + iD with
D = D∗ self-adjoint, and to search for the geometry provided by a spectral triple1 for
which D is the Dirac operator. In this paper we give the construction of a spectral triple
Θ(λ, k) = (A(λ), H(λ), D(λ, k)) which admits, as shown for small values of λ > 1, a
spectrum of 1
2 + iD very similar to the low lying zeros of the Riemann zeta function
(this fact is exempliﬁed in Figure 1, for λ2 = 10.5). More precisely, the spectral triple
Θ(λ, k) depends on λ and also on the choice of an integer k < 2λ2, moreover for a ﬁxed

value of k the positive non-zero eigenvalues λn(D(λ, k)) arranged in increasing order,
vary continuously with λ. A striking fact (discovered numerically at ﬁrst) is that for
special values of λ the dependence of λn(D(λ, k)) on the value of k (close enough to 2λ2)
disappears (see Figure 2 for the case n = 1), while the common value of these λn(D(λ, k))
coincides exactly with the imaginary part of the n-th zero of the Riemann zeta function!
This means that the qualitative resemblance of spectra as in Figure 1 yields in fact a sharp
coincidence in some range: by varying λ in the interval 5 ≤ λ2 ≤ 16.5, and determining
the coinciding eigenvalues up to n = 31 one produces 31 numbers in amazing agreement
with the full collection of values of the ﬁrst 31 zeros of the zeta function (see Figure
3; incidentally notice that the probability of obtaining such agreement from a random
choice is of the order of 10−50 ).

λ1(D(λ, 2k)) of D(λ, 2k). The ordinate of the points where the graphs touch each other is
constant and coincides with the imaginary part ζ1 ∼ 14.134 of the ﬁrst zero of zeta. The
abscissas, i.e. the values of µ, are part of the geometric progression with ratio exp( 2π
) .

Figure 3. Computing the coinciding eigenvalues λj(D(λ, k)) one obtains a list (lower

The main goal of this paper is to provide a theoretical explanation for this numerical
“coincidence” and relate it to the spectral realization of the zeros of zeta given in [3].
The new theoretical concept that emerges is that of a ζ-cycle.

A. Connes and C. Consani

In Section 6.1 we explain how to deﬁne scale invariant Riemann sums for functions
deﬁned on [0, ∞) with vanishing integral. This technique is implemented in the deﬁnition
of the linear map

from the Schwartz space S ev
square integrable functions on the circle C = R∗
is then provided by the following

0 of even functions, f, f (0) = 0, with vanishing integral, to
+/µZ of length L = log µ. The key notion

ΣµE : S ev

0 → L2(C)

Deﬁnition 1.1. A ζ-cycle is a circle C of length L = log µ such that the subspace
ΣµE(S ev

0 ) is not dense in the Hilbert space L2(C).

It turns out that likewise for closed geodesics, ζ-cycles are stable under ﬁnite covers,
and if C is a ζ-cycle of length L, then the n-fold cover of C is a ζ-cycle of length nL, for
any positive integer n > 0.
By construction, the subspace ΣµE(S ev
0 ) ⊂ L2(C) is invariant under the group of rota-
tions of the circle which appears here from the scaling action of the multiplicative group

+ on (ΣµE(S ev

The ad-hoc Sobolev spaces used in [3] to provide the spectral realization of zeros of zeta
are here replaced by the canonical Hilbert space L2(C) of square integrable functions.
Moreover, Theorem 1.1 provides the theoretical explanation for the above coincidence of
spectral values. Indeed, the special values of λ2 = µ = exp L at which the k dependence
of the eigenvalue λn(D(λ, k)) disappear, signal that the related circle of length L is a ζ-
cycle and that λn(D(λ, k)) is in its spectrum. This explains why the low lying part of the
spectrum of the spectral triple Θ(λ, k) possesses a tantalizing resemblance with the low
lying zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Indeed, the special values of the length (L) of
the circle for which the coinciding λn(D(λ, k)) occur, form a part of the arithmetic pro-
gression of multiples of 2π/ζn, where ζn is the imaginary part of the n-th zero of the zeta
function. This forces the graphs of the functions λn(D(µ1/2, k)) to pass through points
of the form (exp(2πm/ζn), ζn) (as in Figure 2) which entails that the low lying spectrum
of D(λ, k) (for k ∼ 2λ2) mimics the low lying zeros of the zeta function.
The spectral triple Θ(λ, k) is a ﬁnite rank perturbation of the Dirac operator on a cir-
cle of length log µ = 2 log λ and involves, as a key ingredient, classical prolate spheroidal
wave functions [13, 12, 11]. These functions are used to deﬁne a ﬁnite dimensional sub-
space (of dimension k) of the Hilbert space of square integrable functions on the circle
of length 2 log λ, and the operator D(λ, k) is then canonically obtained from the oper-
ator of ordinary diﬀerentiation D0(λ) to insure that its kernel contains the above ﬁnite
dimensional subspace.

Spectral triples and ζ-cycles

A priori, there seems to be no relation between the construction of the spectral triple
Θ(λ, k) and the Riemann zeta function: in Section 3 we explain how we stumbled on
Θ(λ, k) while continuing our investigations of the Weil quadratic form restricted to test
functions with support in a ﬁxed interval. The Riemann-Weil explicit formulas give a con-
crete and ﬁnite expression of the semi-local Weil quadratic form (see Section 2) which
is suitable for numerical exploration since it only involves primes less than, say, λ2. By
semi-local Weil quadratic form we mean the restriction QWλ of the sesquilinear form

QW (f, g) :=

One knows that the positivity of the Weil quadratic form QWλ for all λ implies the
Riemann Hypothesis (RH), and in case RH holds, QWλ is known to be strictly positive. In
[14], the positivity was shown to hold for λ =
2 using numerical analysis. In Section 2 we
test numerically this positivity for larger values of λ, showing (§2.2) that the contribution
from the archimedean place alone ceases to be positive in the upper part of the interval
log(λ2) ∈ [log 2 − 0.2, log 2 + 0.2] ∼ [0.493, 0.893], while the positivity is restored by
adding the contribution of the prime 2. This latter contribution depends explicitly on
p = 2 in a form Wp which in fact can be evaluated for any real number p ∼ 2 (i.e.
close to but not equal to 2). We show (§2.3) that by requiring positivity one restricts the
allowed values of p to an interval of size ∼ 10−3 around p = 2, and in §2.4 we display that
when λ2 grows past a prime power and one ignores its contribution, the quadratic form
QWλ fails to remain positive. This fact is displayed up to λ2 ∼ 7. One striking numerical
result is described in §2.5, where we report numerical evidence that as λ increases the
corresponding operator in H(λ) := L2([λ−1, λ], d∗u) admits a ﬁnite number of extremely
small positive eigenvalues. For instance, we ﬁnd that when λ2 = 11 the smallest positive
eigenvalue is 2.389 × 10−48. The corresponding eigenfunctions are graphically reported
in Figures 22, 23, 24.
Section 3 explains conceptually the presence of these extremely small positive eigenvalues
and there we also give an excellent approximation of the related eigenfunctions. The
theoretical reason for the presence of these extremely small eigenvalues springs from the
fact that the radical of the Weil quadratic form contains the range of the map E of [3],
that is deﬁned on the codimension two subspace S ev
0 of even Schwartz functions fulﬁlling
f (0) = (cid:98)f (0) = 0 by

Even though RH implies that QWλ is strictly positive, and thus that its radical is {0}, by
making use of (1.3), one can nevertheless construct functions g with support in [λ−1, λ]
which are in the “near radical” of the Weil quadratic form i.e. fulﬁll QWλ(g) (cid:28) (cid:107)g(cid:107)2.
More precisely, if the support of the even function f ∈ S ev
is contained in the interval
0
[−λ, λ] ⊂ R, the support of E(f ) is contained in (0, λ] ⊂ R∗
+. On the other hand, the
Poisson formula

E( (cid:98)f )(x) = E(f )(x−1) , ∀f ∈ S ev
0

(1.4)

shows that the support of E(f ) is contained in [λ−1, ∞) provided the support of the even
function (cid:98)f is contained in the interval [−λ, λ] ⊂ R. The obstruction to obtain an element
E(f ) of the radical of QWλ is the equality Pλ ∩ (cid:98)Pλ = {0}, where Pλ and (cid:99)Pλ are the
cutoﬀ projections in the Hilbert space L2(R)ev of square integrable even functions (the
projection Pλ is given by the multiplication by the characteristic function of the interval
[−λ, λ] ⊂ R, the projection (cid:99)Pλ is its conjugate by the Fourier transform FeR ). The seminal
work of Slepian and Pollack [13, 12, 11] on band limited functions then shows that while
Pλ ∩ (cid:98)Pλ = {0}, the angle operator between these two projections admits a ﬁnite number
1 + ν(λ2) ∼ 2λ2 of extremely small non zero eigenvalues and that the corresponding
eigenfunctions are the prolate spheroidal wave functions

, m ≤ ν(λ2) ∼ 2λ2.

By construction, each ψm,λ is a function on the interval [−λ, λ] that one extends by 0
outside that interval. Its Fourier transform FeR (ψm,λ) restricted to the interval [−λ, λ],
is equal to χmψm,λ where the scalar χm is very close to (−1)m provided that m is
less than ν(λ2) ∼ 2λ2. After taking care of the two conditions f (0) = (cid:98)f (0) = 0, the
restriction of E(f ) to the interval [λ−1, λ] gives rise to a function which we call a “prolate
vector”, and on which QWλ takes non-zero, but extremely small values. This fact is
veriﬁed concretely in Section 3 where we compare the eigenvectors of the Weil quadratic
form QWλ associated to its smallest eigenvalues with the orthogonalisation of the prolate
vectors obtained using the technique outlined above, from the prolate spheroidal wave
functions.
The construction of the spectral triple Θ(λ, k) is carried out in Section 4. Even though
this construction is motivated by the results of Section 3 on the near radical of the Weil
quadratic form QWλ, the technique involved only uses the prolate vectors without any
reference to QWλ. Using the ﬁrst k + 2 prolate functions, one obtains a k-dimensional
+/λ2Z, d∗u), then one lets Π(λ, k) be the associated
subspace of L2([λ−1, λ], d∗u) (cid:39) L2(R∗
orthogonal projection. By deﬁnition, the spectral triple Θ(λ, k) = (A(λ), H(λ), D(λ, k))
is given by the action by multiplication of the algebra of smooth functions A(λ) :=
+/λ2Z, d∗u), while the operator D(λ, k) is the ﬁnite rank

of the standard Dirac operator D0 = −iu∂u (with periodic boundary conditions when
+/λ2Z)). We compute the low lying spectra of these
viewed in L2([λ−1, λ], d∗u) (cid:39) L2(R∗
spectral triples and ﬁnd a neat resemblance with the low lying zeros of the Riemann
zeta function, provided that k is suﬃciently close to the largest allowed value ν(λ2). On
the other hand, since the eigenvalues λn(D(λ, k)) vary with λ, one cannot expect that
they reproduce exactly the n-th zero of the zeta function. The subtlety of the relation
is explained in Section 5, where we produce several criterions to recover the zeros of the
Riemann zeta function using the non-zero eigenvalues λn(D(λ, k)). First we show that
for k = 2(cid:96), the eigenvalues fulﬁll the inequality λn(D(λ, k + 1)) ≤ λn(D(λ, k)), then we
prove (§5.1) that for certain values of λ one has λn(D(λ, k + 1)) (cid:39) λn(D(λ, k)). When
this happens and k is close enough to the upper bound ν(λ2), the common eigenvalue
coincides with the imaginary part of the n-th zero of the zeta function. This result
is strengthened in §5.2, where we plot the evolution of the eigenvalues λn(D(λ, k)), as
functions of µ = λ2, for ﬁxed k, and ﬁnd that several graphs coincide at the above special
values of λ as displayed in Figure 2. In §5.3 we ﬁnd that the obtained special points in
the (µ, λn) plane fulﬁll the quantization condition

µiλn = 1.

This result suggests that for the above special values of λ one has an eigenvector which
is already an eigenvector of the unperturbed Dirac operator D0. In §5.4 we apply this
criterion to select the special values of λ, and compute the 31 ﬁrst zeros of the Riemann
zeta function with the precision shown in Figure 3. The conceptual explanation of these
experimental ﬁndings is Theorem 1.1 whose proof is developed in the ﬁnal Section 6.

2. The semi-local Weil quadratic form

In this section we test numerically the positivity of the Weil quadratic form QW (f, g),
in the semi local case, namely for test functions f, g with support in the interval [λ−1, λ].
This investigation breaks down in two independent cases so that QWλ = QW +
λ ⊕ QW −
λ ,
according to the parity of f and g with respect to the symmetry operator u (cid:55)→ u−1.
Lemma 2.5 shows that for real test functions, the even functions do not interfere with
the odd ones. Moreover by construction the positivity of QWλ depends on the length
L = 2 log λ of the support of the test functions. We deﬁne in (2.21) an orthonormal basis
{ηn, n ∈ Z} of the Hilbert space L2([λ−1, λ]) formed by odd (for the symmetry u (cid:55)→ u−1)
real functions for n < 0, and by even real functions for n ≥ 0. The matrix σ(n, m) =
QW (ηn, ηm) is the direct sum σ = σ+ ⊕ σ− of two inﬁnite symmetric real matrices, each
of which is expressed as a ﬁnite sum involving the archimedean contribution −WR, as
well as the contribution −Wp from primes p less than µ = λ2. The numerical tests consist
in evaluating the eigenvalues of the very large portion of these matrices corresponding
to indices n and m whose absolute values are ≤ N . These computations give signiﬁcant
evidence that the increasing of large N does not alter substantially the lower part of the
spectrum of σ(n, m). In §2.2 we ﬁnd that the archimedean contribution −WR to the Weil
quadratic form when taken separately, ends to be positive if computed in an interval

8

A. Connes and C. Consani

extending slightly beyond the value L = log 2 (Figure 6). However, the positivity is
restored after that value, and precisely in the interval log 2 ≤ L < log 3, by implementing
also the contribution of the prime p = 2, in terms of the related functional −W2. In
§2.3 we report our numerical ﬁndings supplying evidence to the fact that the sign of
QWλ is also sensitive to the replacement of −W2 by a functional −Wp whose deﬁnition
uses the same formula as −W2 but replaces 2 with p, taken as a real variable in a small
neighborhood of p = 2. Indeed the computations show that the positivity of the quadratic
form fails if one considers real values of p outside an interval of size < 10−3 around 2. In
§2.4 we report graphical evidence indicating how important is the contribution of each
functional −Wp to preserve the positivity of the quadratic form, if the support of the
test function stretches beyond a prime power pn. Finally, in §2.5 we display numerical
evidence of the key fact that by suitably increasing the support of the test functions,
the “even” and “ odd” matrices σ± admit a ﬁnite number of extremely small positive
eigenvalues. The theoretical discussion of this result is presented in section 3.

2.1. The matrix σ = σ+ ⊕ σ−
This subsection describes the choice of test functions used in this paper while performing
the numerical computations. When viewed in Hilbert theoretic terms the restriction
QWλ of the Weil quadratic form to functions with support in the interval [λ−1, λ] is a
lower bounded, lower semi-continuous quadratic form deﬁned on the Hilbert space H :=
L2([λ−1, λ], d∗u) with values in (−∞, +∞]. We choose an orthonormal basis {ηn}n∈Z of
H which is a core for QWλ and compute the eigenvalues of very large portions of the
associated matrix QW (ηn, ηm) = σ(n, m).

2.1.1. Explicit formula. Following [1], one considers the class W of complex valued func-
tions f on R∗
+ which are continuous and with continuous derivative except at ﬁnitely
many points where both f (x) and f (cid:48)(x) have at most a discontinuity of the ﬁrst kind,
and at which the value of f (x) and f (cid:48)(x) is deﬁned as the average of the right and left
limits. Moreover one assumes that for some δ > 0 one has

f (x) = O(xδ), for x → 0+, f (x) = O(x−1−δ), for x → +∞.

The Mellin transform of f ∈ W is deﬁned as

The translation to (equivalent) formulas using the Fourier transform (in place of the

f (cid:55)→ ∆1/2f = F, F (x) = x1/2f (x)

(2.5)

which respects the convolution product and satisﬁes the equalities

(∆1/2f (cid:93))(x) = x1/2f (cid:93)(x) = x−1/2f (x−1) = (∆1/2f )(x−1).

After taking complex conjugates, ∆ is compatible with the natural involutions. For a
rational place v, we set Wv(F ) := Wv(∆−1/2F ), then the above distributions Wp take
the following form

By a lower bounded, lower semi-continuous (lsc) quadratic form q on a Hilbert space H
we mean a lower semi-continuous map2 q : H → (−∞, +∞] which fulﬁlls q(λξ) = |λ|2q(ξ)
for all λ ∈ C, the parallelogram law

q(ξ + η) + q(ξ − η) = 2q(ξ) + 2q(η)

and also an inequality of the form q(ξ) ≥ −c(cid:107)ξ(cid:107)2 for all ξ ∈ H, reﬂecting the lower
bound of q. The associated sesquilinear form (antilinear in the ﬁrst variable) is given on
the domain of q, Dom(q) := {ξ ∈ H | q(ξ) < ∞} by

q(ξ, η) :=

(q(ξ + η) − q(ξ − η) + iq(iξ + η) − iq(iξ − η)) .

By a result of Kato (see [10], Theorem 2) such lower bounded quadratic forms correspond
to lower bounded densely deﬁned self-adjoint operators T ≥ −c on H by the formula

L2(R∗

ish outside [λ−1, λ]. The restriction of the quadratic form Q∞ to L2([λ−1, λ], d∗u) is still
lower semi-continuous and lower bounded, moreover the domain {ξ ∈ L2([λ−1, λ], d∗u) |

Q∞(ξ, ξ) < ∞} is dense since it contains all smooth functions with support in (λ−1, λ).
Thus it remains to show that each of the remaining terms can be written in the form
(cid:104)f | T g(cid:105) with T bounded and self-adjoint in L2([λ−1, λ], d∗u). One has

(cid:98)f (

f (u)u1/2d∗u = (cid:104)h | f (cid:105),

(cid:98)f (− i

(cid:17)

in (2.11) is of the form (cid:104)f | T f (cid:105), where T is the sum of
Thus the term 2(cid:60)
the rank one operators T = |h(cid:105)(cid:104)h∗| + |h∗(cid:105)(cid:104)h|. Let us show that (2.12) deﬁnes a bounded
self-adjoint operator V (n) in L2([λ−1, λ], d∗u). One has

(f ∗ ∗ g)(v) =

(cid:90)

f ∗(vu−1)g(u)d∗u =

(cid:90)

f (v−1u)g(u)d∗u

so that by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality one derives |(f ∗ ∗ g)(v)| ≤ (cid:107)f (cid:107)(cid:107)g(cid:107). This shows
that the equality (f ∗∗g)(v) = |f (cid:105)(cid:104)Vvg| deﬁnes a bounded operator Vv in L2([λ−1, λ], d∗u).
(cid:3)
Moreover its adjoint is V ∗

v = Vv−1 and thus V (n) is bounded and self-adjoint.

Lemma 2.2. Let λ > 1, and U ∈ L2([λ−1, λ], d∗u) be the function U (u) := u
the space of Laurent polynomials C[U, U −1] is a core for the quadratic form QWλ.

iπ
log λ . Then

Proof. Since all terms in (2.11) are bounded except for Q∞, it is enough to show that
C[U, U −1] is a core for the quadratic form Q∞ restricted to L2([λ−1, λ], d∗u). First note
that the powers U n belong to the domain of Q∞ since the Fourier transform of U n is
given by

(cid:99)U n(s) =

(2.13)

Thus the integral of | (cid:99)U n(s)|2∂tθ(t) is absolutely convergent and U n belongs to the domain
of Q∞. Next, given ξ ∈ L2([λ−1, λ], d∗u) such that Q∞(ξ, ξ) < ∞, we want to show that
for any (cid:15) > 0 there exists η ∈ C[U, U −1] such that (with −c the lower bound of Q∞)

(1 + c)(cid:107)ξ − η(cid:107)2 + Q∞(ξ − η, ξ − η) < (cid:15).

(2.14)

We switch from R∗
+ to the additive group R (using the logarithm) and let L = 2 log λ and
H = L2([−L/2, L/2]) ⊂ L2(R). Under this change of variable the function U becomes
U (x) = exp( 2πix

L ). Moreover using the Fourier transform on R (cid:39) (cid:98)R one can write

Q∞(f, f ) :=

one can replace (2.14) by an equivalent condition of ﬁnding, given (cid:15) > 0, a Laurent
polynomial η in U (x) = exp( 2πix

L ) for x ∈ [−L/2, L/2], such that

(cid:90)

|(cid:98)ξ(s) − (cid:98)η(s)|2(1 + log(1 + s2))ds < (cid:15).

(2.16)

We ﬁrst replace ξ by ξ1 with ξ1(x) := ρ ξ(ρx) for ρ > 1, while

(cid:90)

|(cid:98)ξ(s) − (cid:98)ξ1(s)|2(1 + log(1 + s2))ds < (cid:15)/2

(2.17)

This latter inequality holds provided ρ is close enough to 1. Indeed one has

(cid:90)

|(cid:98)ξ(s)|2(1 + log(1 + s2))ds < ∞,

(cid:98)ξ1(s) = (cid:98)ξ(ρ−1s),

while the scaling action S of R∗

+ on the Hilbert space of functions on R with the norm

(cid:90)

(cid:107)f (cid:107)2

1 :=

|f (s)|2(1 + log(1 + s2))ds

is pointwise norm continuous. Note ﬁrst that S(ρ) is bounded uniformly near ρ = 1 since

(cid:90)

|f (ρ−1s)|2(1 + log(1 + s2))ds = ρ

(cid:90)

|f (t)|2(1 + log(1 + ρ2t2))dt

while (1 + log(1 + ρ2t2)) ≤ 2(1 + log(1 + t2)) for all t ∈ R for ρ ≤ 2. The pointwise
norm continuity of S(ρ) follows since this action is pointwise norm continuous on the
dense subspace of continuous functions with compact support. Now the support of ξ1,
ξ1(x) := ρ ξ(ρx) is contained in the interval [−ρ−1L/2, ρ−1L/2]. Thus the convolution
c (R) whose support is contained in a small
ξ2 = φ ∗ ξ1 with a smooth function φ ∈ C∞
enough neighborhood of 0 is a smooth function with support in the interior of the interval
[−L/2, L/2]. Fix such a φ positive with integral equal to 1. Let φn(x) = nφ(nx), and
let ηn = φn ∗ ξ1. One has (cid:98)ηn(s) = (cid:98)φ(s/n)(cid:98)ξ1(s). The functions (cid:98)φ(s/n) are bounded
| (cid:98)φ(s/n)| ≤ 1 and converge pointwise to 1, thus the Lebesgue dominated convergence
theorem shows that for n large enough, one has

(cid:90)

|(cid:98)ξ1(s) − (cid:98)ηn(s)|2(1 + log(1 + s2))ds < (cid:15)/4.

(2.18)

Finally since ηn ∈ C∞
c ((−L/2, L/2)) it can be viewed as a smooth function on the circle
obtained by identifying the end points of the interval [−L/2, L/2] so that there exists a
sequence (ak)k∈Z of rapid decay such that ηn = (cid:80) akU k. Equation (2.13) still holds after
the change of variables and one gets the equality

1 = 4(log λ)2

(cid:90)

| sin(s log λ) (πk − s log λ)−1 |2(1 + log(1 + s2))ds.

One has sin2(s)s−2 ≤ 2(1 + s2)−1, and for any a ∈ R, 1 + (s − a)2 ≤ 2(1 + a2)(1 + s2) so
that log(1+(s−a)2) ≤ log 2+log(1+s2)+log(1+a2). This shows that (cid:107) (cid:98)U k(cid:107)2
1 = O(log |k|)
and hence, since ηn = (cid:80) akU k where the sequence (ak)k∈Z is of rapid decay, one can ﬁnd
N such that η = (cid:80)N

−N akU k fulﬁlls

(cid:90)

|(cid:98)η(s) − (cid:98)ηn(s)|2(1 + log(1 + s2))ds < (cid:15)/4.

Combining (2.17), (2.18), (2.19) one obtains the required approximation.

(cid:3)

Proposition 2.3. Let λ > 1. The quadratic form QWλ : L2([λ−1, λ], d∗u) → (−∞, +∞]
of (2.11) fulﬁlls, for any f ∈ L2([λ−1, λ], d∗u),

QWλ(f ) = lim inf
gn→f

QWλ(gn), gn ∈ C[U, U −1]

(2.20)

Proof. By applying the lower semicontinuity of QWλ one sees that in (2.20) the lhs is
smaller than the rhs. The density of C[U, U −1] in the domain of QWλ for the graph-
norm shown in Lemma 2.2, proves that if f is in the domain of QWλ there exists a
sequence gn of elements of C[U, U −1] converging to f in norm, and such that QWλ(f ) =
(cid:3)
limgn→f QWλ(gn).

Corollary 2.4. The lower bound of QWλ is the limit, when N → ∞, of the smallest
eigenvalue of the restriction of QWλ to the linear span EN of the functions U k for
|k| ≤ N .

2.1.3. Basis of real functions in C[U, U −1]. In order to compute explicitly the smallest
eigenvalue of the restriction of QWλ to the linear span EN of the functions U k, for
|k| ≤ N , as in Corollary 2.4, we ﬁrst ﬁnd a convenient orthonormal basis formed of real
valued functions. We ﬁrst consider the Hilbert space L2([−L/2, L/2]) ⊂ L2(R) with the
inner product deﬁned by the formula

An orthonormal real basis is given, by the constant function ξ0(x) = L−1/2 together with

We note the following simple facts

Lemma 2.5. Let L > 0, φj ∈ L2([−L/2, L/2]) and θ = φ1 ∗ φ∗
(i) The support of θ is contained in the interval [−L, L], and for t ∈ [0, L] one has

2. Then

θ(t) =

θ(−t) =

(ii) If the functions φj are real, then: φ1 ∗ φ∗
(iii) If the functions φj are real, with φ1 even and φ2 odd, then for all t ∈ R one has:

2(−t) = φ2 ∗ φ∗

1(t).

φ1 ∗ φ∗

2(t) + φ2 ∗ φ∗

1(t) = 0.

Proof. (i) The function θ is given, using φ∗

2(x) = φ2(−x), by

θ(t) =

(cid:90)

R

φ1(x)φ2(x − t)dx

t ∈ R.

Since the integrand is not zero only if x ∈ [−L/2, L/2] and x − t ∈ [−L/2, L/2], one can
restrict the integration in the interval [t − L/2, L/2]. The second equality follows using
the equality θ∗ = φ2 ∗ φ∗
1.
(ii) Follows from θ∗ = φ2 ∗ φ∗
1.
(iii) Notice that φ∗
even, thus one derives: φ1 ∗ φ∗

1 = φ1 since φ1 is real and
(cid:3)

2 = −φ2 since φ2 is real and odd, and φ∗

1 = −φ1 ∗ φ2 + φ2 ∗ φ1 = 0.

Proof. (ii) Follows from Lemma 2.5.
(iii) The table reported in (iii) is obtained by direct computation.
(i) The formulas reported in (iii) show that all functions involved are in the domain of
applicability W of the explicit formulas (see §2.1.1). Moreover the terms of the explicit
formulas correspond to the terms which enter in the deﬁnition (2.11) of the quadratic
(cid:3)
form QWλ in Proposition 2.1.

Lemma 2.6 (ii) shows that σ is a symmetric matrix and that

σ(n, m) = 0 , ∀n ≥ 0, m < 0.

Thus σ splits in two blocks σ = σ+ ⊕σ− which we shall call informally as the “even ” and
“odd ” matrices. They correspond to the partition Z = {n ≥ 0} ∪ {n < 0} and one has

QWλ = QW +

λ ⊕ QW −

λ , σ = σ+ ⊕ σ−.

This decomposition shows that the positivity of the Weil quadratic form can be tested
working separately the cases of even functions (using the matrix σ+) and odd functions
(using σ−). In the chosen basis ηn, the even case corresponds to considering elements of
the basis indexed by n ≥ 0, while the odd case involves the ηn’s indexed by n < 0.

2.1.4. The matrix w0,2(n, m). Next, we shall describe the contribution of the ﬁrst two
terms in (2.8) to the matrix σ(m, n). The following lemma shows that these terms
contribute by a rank one matrix to both the odd and the even matrices σ±.

. Its value at L = log 2 is 2.00963.

Figure 4 shows that the coeﬃcient of θsym(0)

is negative near the origin (L = 0), thus
2
its contribution to the quadratic form QW is a positive one for small values of L, due to
the minus sign in front of W +
R (in (2.23)). This very same contribution becomes negative
for larger values of L.

2.2. Sensitivity of Weil positivity, archimedean place

The ﬁrst fact we report from the numerical computations is that the archimedean con-
tribution fails to remain positive when extended a bit beyond the value L = log 2. In the
following two graphs (Figure 5 and 6) we report the variation of the smallest eigenvalue
for the even matrix σ+, as the value of L approaches and then stretches a bit beyond
log 2. When one considers values of L in the interval log 2 ≤ L < log 3, the contribution
of the primes to the Weil quadratic form is only by p = 2, and of the form

Wp(F ) = p−1/2 log p (θ(log p) + θ(− log p)) .

(2.33)

Figure 7 shows that adding the contribution of the prime 2 to the archimedean contribu-
tion restores the positivity of the even matrix σ+. The graph is in terms of µ := exp L,
and this choice of the variable is dictated by the fact that its integer prime power values
play a crucial role in this study.

L ∈ [0, log 2]. The smallest eigenvalue when L = log 2 is ∼ 0.00133.

Figure 6. Change of sign of the smallest eigenvalue of the archimedean contribution to

Figure 7. Change of sign of the smallest eigenvalue for the archimedean contribution
alone, as a function of µ := exp L, near µ = 2 (in yellow). After adding the
contribution of the prime 2 the smallest eigenvalue of the even matrix is > 0 (in blue).

2.3. Sensitivity of Weil positivity to the precise value p = 2

Figure 7 shows that beyond µ = 2 the contribution (2.33) of the prime 2 ﬁrst lowers the
smallest eigenvalue in the interval exp L ∈ (2, 2.27) but then saves it from being negative.
The value of the smallest eigenvalue of σ+ for µ = 3 is < 6 × 10−8. This suggests to use
p as a variable in (2.33) and to test the sensitivity of Weil positivity to the precise value
p = 2. To this end one ﬁxes L = log 3 (i.e. µ = 3) and replaces 2 by a variable p in (2.33).

Figure 8. Sensitivity to the precise value p = 2.

As Figure 8 shows, one ﬁnds that the smallest eigenvalue λ(p) for L = log 3 is negative
for p = 1.9999 and also for p = 2.0005, so that the positivity requirement restricts the
choice of p to an interval of size < 10−3 around p = 2.

2.4. Change of sign of smallest eigenvalue

Beyond p = 3 the sign of the smallest eigenvalue of the sum of the contributions of ∞
and 2 to the even matrix σ+ is reported in yellow in Figure 9. Once again we notice
that its negative behavior beyond µ = 3 is “ﬁxed” and the output (in blue in the ﬁgure)
switches to be positive by adding the contribution of the prime 3.

When µ goes beyond the prime power 4 = 22, the behavior of the smallest eigenvalue

is similar to the earlier reported cases and is shown in Figure 10.

yellow if one neglects the contribution of the prime power 4 = 22, in blue if one does

For µ ∼ 5, and µ ∼ 7 the behavior of the smallest eigenvalue for the even matrix σ+ is

similar to those shown in the earlier cases and is reported in Figures 11 and 12.

2.5. Semi-local Weil quadratic form, small eigenvalues

Pushing the computations further and increasing the precision, one obtains an estimate
of the size of the smallest eigenvalue s(L) of the even matrix, as a function of µ = exp L.
One ﬁnds an exponential behavior, as reported in Figures 18 and 19, where log s(L) is
plotted in terms of µ = exp L.

Figure 18. Decay of the log of the
smallest eigenvalue of the even matrix
as a function of µ = exp L .

Figure 19. Decay of the log of the
smallest eigenvalue of the odd matrix
as a function of exp L .

When one selects the small eigenvalues of the even matrix σ+ and plots the graphs of
the logarithm of their size, one ﬁnds (see Figure 20) that their number increases roughly
like µ = exp L.

For the odd matrix σ−, the behavior is similar but with one less small eigenvalue, as

shown in Figure 21.

3. Eigenfunctions and the prolate projection Π(λ, k)

In this section we explain the existence of the very small eigenvalues of the Weil quadratic
form QWλ on test functions with support in an interval [λ−1, λ] ⊂ R∗
+. We start by
recalling that if RH holds, then the Weil quadratic form restricted to functions with
support in a ﬁnite interval has zero radical, since the number N (r) of zeros of modulus
at most r of the Fourier transform of a function f with compact support is of the order
N (r) = O(r) (see [8] §15.20 (2)), while if f belonged to the radical of QW it would
(assuming RH), vanish on all zeros of the Riemann zeta function whose number grows
faster than O(r). On the other hand, the radical of QW contains the range of the map E
0 ⊂ S(R) of even Schwartz functions fulﬁlling
deﬁned on the codimension two subspace S ev
f (0) = (cid:98)f (0) = 0 by the formula ([3])

E(f )(x) = x1/2 (cid:88)

f (nx).

n>0

(3.1)

It is thus natural to bring-in (3.1) for the construction of functions g with support in
[λ−1, λ] ⊂ R∗
+ which belong to the “near radical” of QWλ i.e. fulﬁll QWλ(g) (cid:28) (cid:107)g(cid:107)2.
The deﬁnition of E shows that if the support of the even function f ∈ S ev
is contained
0
in the interval [−λ, λ] ⊂ R, then the support of E(f ) is contained in (0, λ] ⊂ R∗
+. On the
other hand, by applying the Poisson formula (with (cid:98)f the Fourier transform of f ) one has

E( (cid:98)f )(x) = E(f )(x−1) , ∀f ∈ S ev
0 .

(3.2)

Thus we see that λ−1 would be a lower bound of the support of E(f ) if the support of
0 were contained in the interval [−λ, λ] ⊂ R. However this latter
the even function (cid:98)f ∈ S ev
inclusion is impossible since the Fourier transform of a function with compact support is
analytic. In spite of this apparent obstacle in the construction, the work of Slepian and
Pollack on band limited functions [11] provides a very useful approximate solution. The
conceptual way to formulate their result is in terms of the pair of projections Pλ and
(cid:99)Pλ in the Hilbert space L2(R)ev of square integrable even functions. The operator Pλ
is the multiplication by the characteristic function of the interval [−λ, λ] ⊂ R, and the
projection (cid:99)Pλ is its conjugate by the (additive) Fourier transform FeR . These two pro-
jections have zero intersection but their “angle”, – an operator with discrete spectrum–
admits approximatively 2λ2 very small eigenvalues whose associated eigenfunctions pro-
vide excellent candidates for the “approximate intersection” Pλ ∩(cid:48) (cid:99)Pλ. In their work
on signals transmission, Slepian and Pollack discovered that these eigenfunctions are
exactly the prolate spheroidal wave functions which were already known to be solutions
(by separation of variables) of the Helmoltz equation for prolate spheroids.

The basic result of Slepian and Pollack is the diagonalisation of the positive operator
Pλ (cid:99)PλPλ in the Hilbert space L2([−λ, λ]). They show that this operator commutes with
the diﬀerential operator

(Wλψ)(q) = −∂((λ2 − q2)∂) ψ(q) + (2πλq)2 ψ(q)

(3.3)

26

A. Connes and C. Consani

(here ∂ is the ordinary diﬀerentiation in one variable q ∈ [−λ, λ] and the dense domain is
that of smooth functions on [−λ, λ]). The operator Wλ (obtained by closing its domain
in the graph norm) is selfadjoint and positive and its eigenfunctions are the prolate
spheroidal wave functions. When considering the Weil quadratic form QWλ evaluated on
test functions with support in [λ−1, λ] we shall compare the eigenvectors associated to the
extremely small eigenvalues with the range of the map E applied to linear combinations of
eigenfunctions ψ of Wλ which belong to the approximate intersection Pλ ∩(cid:48) (cid:99)Pλ and vanish
at zero. For this process, we only take the eigenfunctions ψ which are even functions of
the variable q, and distinguish two cases since the action of the Fourier transform fulﬁlls
FeRψ (cid:39) ±ψ on eigenfunctions ψ of Wλ. The corresponding sign ± determines precisely
the choice of an eigenvector for the even or odd matrix. In standard notation one sets

ψm,λ(x) := PS 2m,0

(cid:16)

2πλ2,

(cid:17)

x
λ

where ψm,λ is a function on the interval [−λ, λ] that one extends by 0 outside that
interval. Its Fourier transform FeR (ψm,λ) is equal to χmψm,λ on [−λ, λ], where the scalar
χm is very close to (−1)m provided that m is less than 2λ2. More precisely, FeR (ψm,λ) is
computed using the equality

(cid:90) 1

−1

PS 2m,0(γ, η) exp(iγηω) dη = (−1)m2S(1)

2m,0(γ, 1)PS 2m,0(γ, ω)

for γ = 2πλ2, ω = y

λ . After changing variables to ξ = λ η, the equality above becomes

(cid:90) λ

−λ

ψm,λ(ξ) exp(i2πξy) dξ = (−1)m2λS(1)

2m,0(2πλ2, 1)ψm,λ(y).

Given µ = λ2, one only retains the values of m for which the characteristic value
χ(µ, m) = 2λS(1)
2m,0(2πµ, 1) is almost equal to 1. This determines a collection {0, . . . , ν(µ)}
of length approximately equal to 2µ, such that χ(µ, m) ∼ 1 for m ≤ ν(µ). The formula
ν(µ) = 2µ − 1 works well when µ is a small half integer.

Figure 25. Graphs of the functions χ(µ, m) as functions of µ .

In order to deﬁne the prolate projection we consider linear combinations of prolate

functions which vanish at 0 and are given, for n > 0, by

φ2n(x) := ψ2n(x)ψ0(0) − ψ0(x)ψ2n(0), φ2n+1(x) := ψ2n+1(x)ψ1(0) − ψ1(x)ψ2n+1(0).

For 1 < n ≤ ν(µ) one may approximate FeR (φn) by (−1)nφn and, using the Poisson
formula, act as if E(φn) would fulﬁll the equality E(φn)(u−1) = (−1)nE(φn)(u). We
can then compute the components of E(φn) in the orthogonal basis ηj(u) = ξj(log u)
of H = L2([λ−1, λ], d∗x) (Lemma 2.6) which fulﬁll ηj(u−1) = −ηj(u) for j < 0 and
ηj(u−1) = ηj(u) for j ≥ 0. For 1 < n ≤ ν(µ), the component of E(φn) on ηj is non-zero
only if ηj has the same parity as n, i.e. fulﬁlls ηj(u−1) = (−1)nηj(u), and in this case is
given by the formula,

E(φn)j (cid:39) 2

(cid:90) λ/r

(cid:88)

1≤r<λ

1

u1/2φn(ru)ηj(u)d∗u.

(3.4)

One computes all these components for |j| ≤ N with N large, and applies the Gram-
Schmidt orthogonalization process (separately for the even and odd cases) to the
obtained vectors in EN . This process determines orthonormal vectors (cid:15)n ∈ EN ⊂ H =
L2([λ−1, λ], d∗x) for 1 < n ≤ ν(µ) which are, by construction, the natural candidate
functions to be compared (up to sign) with the eigenfunctions of the semi-local Weil
quadratic form QWλ on EN .

Deﬁnition 3.1. Let k < ν(λ2). We deﬁne Π(λ, k) as the orthogonal projection on the
linear span of the vectors (cid:15)n, for n ∈ {2, . . . , k + 1}.

Let γ be the grading operator in H = L2([λ−1, λ], d∗x) which takes the values ±1 on
functions satisfying the equality f (u−1) = ±f (u). By construction, the vectors (cid:15)n are
eigenvectors of γ and the following commutativity holds

γ Π(λ, k) = Π(λ, k) γ , ∀λ, k

(3.5)

The series of graphs reported here below display the coincidence of the (cid:15)n with the actual
eigenfunctions of the semi-local Weil quadratic form QWλ for the smallest eigenvalues.
When only one graph appears (in yellow the graph of the (cid:15)’s) this means that the graphs
of the two functions match with a high precision, otherwise the graph in blue of the
eigenfunction is no longer hidden behind the yellow graph. Notice that the coincidence of
(cid:15)2m with the eigenfunction of the even matrix for its m-th eigenvalue is expected to hold
only when this eigenvalue is small and hence only when µ > m. Similarly, one expects
the coincidence of (cid:15)2m+1 with the eigenfunction of the odd matrix for its m-th eigenvalue
only when µ > m + 1 (since the number of small eigenvalues of the odd matrix is one
less than for the even one). We have nevertheless plotted the graphs for all half integer
values of µ between 3.5 and 11 to show the mismatch of the graphs when µ is too small.

4. The spectral triple Θ(λ, k) = (A(λ), H(λ), D(λ, k))

The spectral triple Θ(λ, k) = (A(λ), H(λ), D(λ, k)) described in this section, whose
spectrum has a remarkable similarity with the low lying zeros of the Riemann zeta func-
tion is deﬁned through the action by multiplication of the algebra of smooth functions
+/λ2Z, d∗u). The operator
A(λ) := C∞(R∗
D(λ, k) is deﬁned by the following formula

+/λ2Z) on the Hilbert space H(λ) := L2(R∗

D(λ, k) := (1 − Π(λ, k)) ◦ D0(λ) ◦ (1 − Π(λ, k)), D0(λ) := (−iu∂u).

(4.1)

This is a ﬁnite rank perturbation of the standard Dirac operator D0(λ), since by con-
struction the range of the prolate projection Π(λ, k) is contained in the domain of D0(λ),
so that one derives

D(λ, k) = D0(λ) − Π(λ, k)D0(λ) − D0(λ)Π(λ, k) + Π(λ, k)D0(λ)Π(λ, k).

Proposition 4.1. The operator D(λ, k), combined with the action of periodic functions
by multiplication in L2([−L/2, L/2]) deﬁnes a spectral triple.

Proof. The operator D(λ, k) is a ﬁnite rank perturbation of D0(λ), thus by the Kato-
Rellich theorem (see [9] Proposition 8.6) it is essentially self-adjoint on any core of D0(λ).
The domain of D(λ, k) is the same as the domain of D0(λ) and the boundedness of the
(cid:3)
commutator [D(λ, k), f ] follows from the boundedness of the perturbation.

To compare the spectrum of D(λ, k), for k just below the upper bound ν(λ2) ∼ 2λ2
(discussed in section 3), with the zeros of the Riemann zeta function, one needs to
select an appropriate range of eigenvalues for which the comparison is meaningful. By
construction the number of eigenvalues of D(λ, k) in the interval [0, E] has the same
asymptotic behavior as for D0(λ), and thus diﬀers from the asymptotic behavior of the
number N (E) of zeros of the Riemann zeta function with imaginary part in the interval
[0, E], namely

N (E) = #{ρ | ζ(ρ) = 0, and 0 < (cid:61)(ρ) ≤ E}.

(4.2)

This number is the sum of two contributions: N (E) = (cid:104)N (E)(cid:105) + Nosc(E). The oscillatory
term Nosc(E) is of order log E and, more importantly in this context, one knows that

(cid:104)N (E)(cid:105) =

(4.3)

When considering the operator D(λ, k), with k smaller and close to the upper bound
ν(λ2), we let µ = λ2 and we obtain the following

Proposition 4.2. For E = 2πµ, the number N (cid:48)(E) of non-zero eigenvalues of the
operator D(λ, k) in the interval (0, E] fulﬁlls N (cid:48)(E) ∼ (cid:104)N (E)(cid:105).

Spectral triples and ζ-cycles

35

Proof. It follows from (3.5) that D(λ, k)γ = −γD(λ, k) so that the number of eigenval-
ues of D(λ, k) of absolute value less than E is 2N (cid:48)(E) plus the dimension of the kernel
of D(λ, k). The spectrum of D(λ, k) is a perturbation of the spectrum of D0(λ) i.e. of
L | k ∈ Z}. The perturbation increases the dimension of the kernel of D(λ, k) by the
{ 2πk
dimension of the projection Π(λ, k) i.e. by k ∼ 2µ, up to a log µ term. Thus, the number
of non-zero eigenvalues of D(λ, k) with absolute value less than E has an approximated
size equal to

4.1. Examples µ = 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 9.5

In this part we report some numerical evidence showing the close resemblance of the
spectrum of D(λ, k) with the low lying zeros of the Riemann zeta function, for a sample
of small values of µ.

4.1.1. µ = 5.5. For µ = 5.5, the cosine eigenvalues χ(5.5, n) are extremely close to 1
when n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and given for the next values of n in the following table

0.57197061534624863399

Thus one derives that ν(5.5) = 10, since the next eigenvalue 0.5719706153 is far from 1.
One has 2π5.5 ∼ 34.5575. The following table compares the positive eigenvalues λj =

ﬁrst zeros of the Riemann zeta function (right column)

4.2. Average discrepancy
For an objective comparison of the N (cid:48)(2πµ) eigenvalues λj of size up to 2πµ, with the
imaginary parts ζj of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function, one has at disposal the
following three possible measures of the discrepancy

1. Mean absolute error:

A(µ) :=

1
N (cid:48)(2πµ)

(cid:88)

|λj − ζj|

When this error is computed for the values of µ used in the previous pages it gives
the following list of values

A(5.5) = 0.635176, A(6.5) = 0.44693, A(7.5) = 0.528827,

2. Root-mean-square deviation. It is deﬁned as the square root of the average value of

A(8.5) = 0.456739, A(9.5) = 0.395068

the square deviation

(cid:115)

R(µ) :=

1
N (cid:48)(2πµ)

(cid:88)

(λj − ζj)2

This gives the following list of values

R(5.5) = 0.691088, R(6.5) = 0.48858, R(7.5) = 0.650648,

R(8.5) = 0.562489, R(9.5) = 0.459776

3. Normalized root-mean-square deviation. This deviation is obtained by dividing the
root-mean-square deviation by the diameter of the range of the variables. It is
invariant under aﬃne transformations and is thus a good measure of the
discrepancy, usually expressed as a percentage. The diameter of the range of the
variables is here equal to 2πµ − 14, and this gives the list,

N R(5.5) = 0.0375848, N R(6.5) = 0.0185609, N R(7.5) = 0.0205914,

42

A. Connes and C. Consani

N R(8.5) = 0.0148189, N R(9.5) = 0.0103126, N R(10.5) = 0.00995148

These numbers show that the normalized root-mean-square deviation is steadily improv-
ing and reaches 1% (one percent) for µ = 9.5 and then drops to less than one percent for
µ = 10.5.

5. Zeta zeros from eigenvalues of spectral triples

In the previous section we explored the low lying eigenvalues of the spectral triples
Θ(λ, k) = (A(λ), H(λ), D(λ, k)) for k = 2(cid:96) an even number as close as possible to the
boundary ν(λ2) ∼ 2λ2 of the allowed interval. These numerical results give evidence of
a deep relation between the low lying spectrum λn(D(λ, k)) of these spectral triples and
the low lying zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The dependence on the parameters
(λ, k), and the diﬀerence between the growth of the eigenvalues and that of the zeros of
zeta, show that the relation is certainly more subtle than a simple equality between the
eigenvalues λn(D(λ, k)) and the imaginary part ζn of the zeros.

The main observation of this section is that, for any n ∈ N there are special values
of the parameter λ at which the dependence of λn(D(λ, k)) on k disappears. For these
special values of λ the common value of the λn(D(λ, k)) coincides with the imaginary
part ζn of the n-th zero of the Riemann zeta function. Moreover, these special values of
λ form a geometric progression whose scale factor is the exponential of π/ζn.

This observation was ﬁrst experimentally tested and it will be fully and conceptually

justiﬁed in section 6.

We shall pursue 4 diﬀerent criterions to detect these special values of λ. They are

• Comparison of λn(D(λ, 2(cid:96))) with λn(D(λ, 2(cid:96) + 1)) (§5.1)
• Evolution of λn(D(λ, k)) as a function of λ (§5.2)
• Quantization criterion x2iy = 1 applied to the point (λ, λn(D(λ, k))) (§5.3)
• How far is the eigenvector ξn(D(λ, k)) for D(λ, k) from being an eigenvector of D0(λ)

The numerical tests of these criterions show their agreement, but the precision becomes
very sharp when one applies the last criterion. Applying the last method for the small
range of λ in the interval (2, 4) one obtains the agreement with the ﬁrst 31 zeros ζn (n ≤
31) of zeta with suﬃcient accuracy to assess the probability of a fortuitous coincidence
at 10−50.

5.1. The criterion λn(D(λ, 2(cid:96))) ∼ λn(D(λ, 2(cid:96) + 1))
The ﬁrst step in order to detect the special values of λ is to see what happens if one
replaces k = 2(cid:96) by the odd number k + 1 = 2(cid:96) + 1. One sees that the positive eigenvalues
λn(D(λ, ∗)) decrease and actually agree for special values of λ. We ﬁrst brieﬂy explain
why λn(D(λ, 2(cid:96))) ≥ λn(D(λ, 2(cid:96) + 1)) and then display some numerical results showing
the coincidence for special values of λ. By construction, the kernel of D(λ, k) contains
the range of Π(λ, k) and is thus at least of dimension k. Moreover by (3.5) one has, for
the grading γ of H(λ),

γ D(λ, k) = −D(λ, k) γ

(5.1)

Spectral triples and ζ-cycles

43

The kernel of the operator D0(λ) is one dimensional and given by the constant function
1λ which is even (i.e. γ(1λ) = 1λ). This implies that the graded index of the operator
D0(λ) is equal to 1. Then by stability of the index it follows that the graded index of the
operator D(λ, k) is also equal to 1. This means that the signature of the restriction of γ to
the kernel of D(λ, k) is 1 and hence that the dimension of ker(D(λ, k)) is an odd number.
Thus for k = 2(cid:96) even it is natural to expect this kernel to be of dimension k + 1. This
entices one to compare the two non-zero eigenvalues λn(D(λ, k)) and λn(D(λ, k + 1)).
By construction one has Π(λ, k) < Π(λ, k + 1), and we now explain why the positive
eigenvalues of these operators, arranged in increasing order, fulﬁll the inequality

λn(D(λ, k + 1)) ≤ λn(D(λ, k)) , ∀n, λ

(5.2)

Lemma 5.1. Let A be a self-adjoint matrix of dimension N , and E ⊂ KerA a subspace
of its kernel. Then the positive eigenvalues µn(A) arranged in decreasing order fulﬁll

µn(A) = max

F |dim F =n
F ⊥E

(cid:104)ξ | Aξ(cid:105)

min
ξ∈F
(cid:107)ξ(cid:107)=1

(5.3)

Proof. By the mini-max theorem of Courant-Fisher one has

µn(A) = max

F |dim F =n

(cid:104)ξ | Aξ(cid:105)

min
ξ∈F
(cid:107)ξ(cid:107)=1

and we need to show that the added condition that F is perpendicular to E does not
change the maximum. It can only lower it and it is enough to check that the choice of
F which reaches the maximum in the Courant-Fisher formula does fulﬁll F ⊥ E. Indeed
this F is the linear span of the eigenvectors for eigenvalues µk(A) for k ≤ n, and all these
(cid:3)
eigenvectors are orthogonal to the kernel of A since µk(A) ≥ µn(A) > 0 for k ≤ n.

Proposition 5.2. Let D ∈ MN (C) be a self-adjoint matrix.
(i) Let P ∈ MN (C) be a projection (self-adjoint idempotent) and Q = 1−P , DP := QDQ.
Then the positive eigenvalues of DP arranged in decreasing order fulﬁll the equality

µn(DP ) = max

F |dim F =n
F ⊥P

(cid:104)ξ | Dξ(cid:105)

min
ξ∈F
(cid:107)ξ(cid:107)=1

(5.4)

(ii) Let Pj ∈ MN (C) be projections such that P1 ≤ P2. Then, with the notations of (i)
the positive eigenvalues of DPj fulﬁll the inequality

µn(DP2) ≤ µn(DP1)

(5.5)

Proof. (i) By (5.3) applied for A = DP and E = P (CN ) one has

µn(DP ) =

max
F |dim F =n,F ⊥E

min
ξ∈F |(cid:107)ξ(cid:107)=1

(cid:104)ξ | DP ξ(cid:105)

44

A. Connes and C. Consani

and for ξ ⊥ E one has Qξ = ξ so that

(cid:104)ξ | DP ξ(cid:105) = (cid:104)ξ | QDQξ(cid:105) = (cid:104)Qξ | DQξ(cid:105) = (cid:104)ξ | Dξ(cid:105)

which gives (5.4).
(ii) We apply (5.4) to µn(DPj ). The condition F ⊥ P2 is more restrictive than F ⊥ P1
(cid:3)
so one obtains (5.5).

of µ ∈ I = [5, 16.5], i.e. by minimizing the diﬀerence λn(D(λ, k)) − λn(D(λ, k + 1)) on

When dealing with the operators D(λ, k), with k close to the largest allowed value ν(λ2) ∼
2λ2 one introduces necessarily a discontinuity due to the discrete nature of the variable
k. To avoid it one can, for ﬁxed k, consider the dependence of the eigenvalues λn(D(λ, k))
as long as λ is suﬃciently large so that k < ν(λ2). One ﬁnds that for the values (cid:96) = 2, 3,
the λn(D(λ, 2(cid:96))) agree around µ ∼ 3.8 and that their common value is close to ζ1. This

fact is all the more remarkable that when µ < 4 i.e. λ < 2 there is no summation involved
in the (3.4). For (cid:96) = 3, 4, 5, the λn(D(λ, 2(cid:96))) agree around µ ∼ 5.95 and again we ﬁnd
that their common value is close to ζ1. For (cid:96) = 5, 6, 7, 8, the λn(D(λ, 2(cid:96))) agree around
µ ∼ 9.2 and again their value is close to ζ1. For (cid:96) = 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 the λn(D(λ, 2(cid:96)))
agree around µ ∼ 14.4 and their value is close to ζ1. The special values of µ at which
the graphs meet appear to form a geometric progression. One ﬁnds that the ratio of
consecutive terms is ∼ exp(2π/ζ1) and, more generally that for the n-th eigenvalue the
special values of µ form a geometric progression with scale ratio ∼ exp(2π/ζn) where
ζn is the imaginary part of the n-th zero of zeta. These “experimental” facts will be
theoretically explained by Theorem 6.4.

5.3. Quantization of length log µ

The fact that many graphs of the eigenvalues λn(D(λ, k)) meet at some speciﬁc points of
the plane suggests that one could push the comparison even further and compare these
points with the spectrum of the unperturbed operator D0(λ). In terms of the coordinates
(x, y) where x = µ = λ2 and y = λn(D(λ, k)), the spectrum of D0(λ) is characterized by
the quantization condition xiy = 1. The subset of the plane deﬁned by this condition is
the union of the graphs of the functions 2πn/ log x.

Figure 48. Coincidence with solutions of xiy = 1.

Figure 48 shows a perfect agreement between these graphs and the meeting points of
the eigenvalue graphs. Independently of this result, one can measure how far the point
(µ, λn(D(λ, k)) is from fulﬁlling the quantization condition by writing it in the form

µiλn(D(λ,k)) = 1 ⇐⇒ |µiλn(D(λ,k)) − 1| = 0

and by plotting the graphs of these functions for each integer n. They are shown in
Figure 49 for n = 1 and in Figure 54 for n = 2. The key fact here is that the values of
µ at which these functions vanish coincide with the previously determined values where
λ1(D(λ, k + 1)) ∼ λ1(D(λ, k)) of Figures 44 and 45.

5.4. The criterion of common eigenvector for D(λ, k) and D0(λ)
The agreement of the quantization with the meeting points of the graphs of the eigenval-
ues suggests that all the eigenvectors of the D(λ, k) involved agree with each other and
are in fact eigenvectors of the unperturbed operator D0(λ). This gives a very strong cri-
terion obtained by measuring the Hilbert space distance of an eigenvector ξn(D(λ, k)) for
D(λ, k) with the eigenvector of D0(λ) which has the same rotation number. In Figures

with the values determined by the three previous criteria. Finally Figure 53 compares

ﬁrst 31 zeros of the Riemann zeta function.

6. ζ-cycles

The aim of this section is to provide a theoretical explanation for the numerical compu-
tations reported in the previous part of this paper, and in particular to give a theoretical
justiﬁcation for the close similarity of the spectrum of the operator D(λ, k) in the spec-
tral triple θ(λ, k) (see Section 4) and the low lying zeros of the Riemann zeta function.
The goal we shall pursue here is to relate these intriguing numerical results with the
spectral realization of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function, as developed in [3]. The
new theoretical concept emerging is that of a ζ-cycle C. In the following part we ﬁrst
explain how to deﬁne scale invariant Riemann sums for functions deﬁned on [0, ∞) with
vanishing integral. This technique is then implemented in the deﬁnition of a linear map
ΣµE : S ev
0 → L2(C) which plays a central role in this development and enters in the deﬁ-
nition of the ζ-cycle (Deﬁnition 6.1). In §6.2 we prove that ζ-cycles are stable under ﬁnite
covers, and ﬁnally we state and prove the main result of this paper, namely Theorem
6.4. This result naturally selects a family of Hilbert spaces H(L) := ΣµE(S ev
0 )⊥ naturally
associated to the critical zeros of the Riemann zeta function.

Lemma 6.1. Let f be a function of bounded variation on (0, ∞), of rapid decay for
u → ∞, O(u2) when u → 0, and such that (cid:82) ∞

hold
(i) E(f )(u) is well-deﬁned pointwise, is O(u1/2) when u → 0 and of rapid decay for
u → ∞.

implies

Proof. The conditions deﬁning the subspace S ev

Moreover one has: ϑ(λ)Σµ = Σµϑ(λ). Thus, since S ev

Deﬁnition 6.1. A ζ-cycle is a circle C of length L = log µ such that the subspace

As for closed geodesics, the ζ-cycles are stable under ﬁnite covers.

Proposition 6.3. Let C be a ζ-cycle of length L = log µ, then for any positive integer
n > 0 the n-fold cover of C is a ζ-cycle.

Proof. Let π : Cn → C be the n-fold cover of C. From the adjunction of the operation
π∗ : L2(C) → L2(Cn) with the operation of sum on the preimage of a point, it follows

that if a vector ξ ∈ L2(C) belongs to the orthogonal to ΣµE(S ev

(6.4)

To justify the use of Fubini theorem in proving (6.4), note that for N > 1 one derives
from Lemma 6.1 the following estimate

(cid:88)

|f (nu)| ≤ Cu−N (cid:88)

n−N = C (cid:48)u−N , ∀u > 1

n≥1

n≥1

which shows that the series (cid:80)
instead the rough estimate, due to the absolute integrability of f , of the form

n≥1 |f (nu)| is of rapid decay for u → ∞. For u → 0 we use

(cid:88)

|f (nu)| = O(u−1).

This ensures the validity of Fubini for (cid:61)(z) > 1/2. Now, we know that ζ( 1
2 − iz) has a
pole at z = i/2, but since ψ(i/2) = 0 this singularity does not aﬀect the above product
ζ( 1
2 − iz)ψ(z) which is thus holomorphic in the half plane (cid:61)(z) > −5/2. By applying
Lemma 6.1, we see that the function E(f )(u) is O(u1/2) when u → 0 and of rapid decay
for u → ∞. Thus (cid:82)
E(f )(u)u−izd∗u is holomorphic in the half-plane (cid:61)(z) > −1/2.
Therefore one may conclude that (6.4) holds when z ∈ R and, if ζ( 1
2 + is) = 0, one
obtains

At the beginning of this proof one has deﬁned L = 2πn/s: let now µ = exp L then one has
+/µZ
µis = exp(2πin) = 1. In this way the function χ(u) := uis is well-deﬁned on C = R∗
and the following vanishing holds in L2(C)

Proof. Assume ﬁrst that sL = n with s and n positive. Then it follows from Theorem
6.4 (ii), that H(L) (cid:54)= {0}, since the circle of length L is a zeta-cycle. Conversely, if
H(L) (cid:54)= {0} then the circle C of length L is a zeta-cycle and there exists by Theorem
6.4 (i), a positive s ∈ Z and a non zero vector ξ ∈ H(L) such that ϑ(λ)(ξ) = λisξ for
all λ ∈ R∗
+. Since the action of R∗
+ on L2(C) is periodic of period µ = exp(L) we have
(cid:3)
µis = 1 and this entails sL ∈ 2πZ.

7. Outlook

In this paper we have unveiled a new compelling relation between noncommutative geom-
etry and the Riemann zeta function using the concept of spectral triple. The previous
relations are
• The BC system is a system of quantum statistical mechanics with spontaneous

symmetry breaking which admits the Riemann zeta function as its partition function.

• The adele class space of Q is a noncommutative space, dual to the BC-system and

directly related to the zeros of the L-functions with Grossencharacter [3].

• The quantized calculus is a key ingredient of the semi-local trace formula and it

provides a source of positivity for the Weil quadratic form [6].

It turns out that the adele class space of Q in its topos theoretic incarnation as the
Scaling Site (the topos S = [0, ∞) (cid:111) N×) is the natural parameter space for the circles
of length L which play a critical role in the present paper. Proposition 6.3 gives the
compatibility of ζ-cycles with the action of N× by multiplication on the parameter L.
The action of N× coming from coverings turns L2(C) into a sheaf over the Scaling Site S .
The family of subspaces ΣµE(S0) ⊂ L2(C) generate a subsheaf of modules over the sheaf
of smooth functions and one is then entitled to consider the cohomology of the quotient
sheaf over S . Endowed with the R∗
+-equivariance this cohomology provides the spectral
realization of the critical zeros of zeta, taking care, in particular, of eventual multiplicity.
We shall discuss this fact in details in a forthcoming paper which, in particular, gives an
application of the algebraic geometry over S developed in [4]

Finally, the stability of ζ-cycles under coverings is reminiscent of the behavior of closed
geodesics in a Riemannian manifold, suggesting to look for a mysterious “cusp” whose
closed geodesics would correspond to ζ-cycles.
