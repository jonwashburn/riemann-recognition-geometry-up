A remark on density theorems for Riemann’s
zeta-function

by
J´anos Pintz∗

Dedicated to the memory of Jingrun Chen on the occasion of
the 50th anniversary of the publication of his celebrated (1 + 2)
theorem on Goldbach’s conjecture

The plausibility of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) is supported (among oth-
ers) by results of type

It was Hoheisel [Hoh1930] who ﬁrst observed that such estimates lead
to arithmetic consequences about the diﬀerence of consecutive primes. He
proved the ﬁrst approximation towards the famous conjecture that there ex-
ists always a prime between two consecutive squares. This conjecture was
characterised by Landau [Lan1913] in his plenary talk at ICM1912 in Cam-
bridge as one of the four main problems of the distribution of primes, besides
the Riemann Hypothesis. Hoheisel [Hoh1930] could show (pn denotes the nth
prime)

In the proof important role was played by Carlson’s density theorem (1.2)–
(1.3).

Later it was realized that a uniform estimate of the form

yields (combined with a slightly better zero-free region than the classical one
of de la Vall´ee Poussin)

pn ≪ε p1−1/A+ε

for any ε > 0.

In particular, the best possible estimate A = 2 would almost imply Lan-
dau’s conjecture. This is especially remarkable in light of the fact that even
assuming the Riemann Hypothesis the best estimate we know is

pn+1 −

pn ≪

n logC pn

(with C = 2 easily by the Riemann–Von Mangoldt explicit formula, with
C = 1 by a deeper argument of Cram´er [Cra1921]).

This explains the signiﬁcance of the Density Hypothesis (DH) which

states

In 1954 Tur´an [Tur1954] used his celebrated power-sum method [Tur1953],
[Tur1984] to give a diﬀerent proof of Ingham’s result that LH implies DH. In
the same work he came very close to breaking the DH in the vicinity of the
boundary line σ = 1. In the following we will use the notation:

(1.11)

s = σ + it, σ = 1

His result was with a small constant c1 [Tur1954]

or with our new notation

It was 16 years later when G. Hal´asz and Tur´an succeeded to break the
DH [HT1969], that is, to prove (in the reﬁned form appearing as Theorem
38.2 of Tur´an’s book [Tur1984]) with the notation (1.1)–(1.2), (1.11)

Soon after this Bombieri [Bom1971] gave a diﬀerent proof using ideas
from the large sieve coupled with (i) and (iii). Further, Montgomery has
shown the DH for σ
1/10 ([Mon1969], [Mon1971]). Using

another simple but ingenious idea Huxley [Hux1972] (with a reﬁnement of
Montgomery) reached the DH for η

The DH was shown for larger and larger ranges, until improving the result

Another direction of the research was to give strong density estimates
for small values of η (often especially for η
0). In this direction the most
important results were reached (in alphabetical order) by Bourgain, Ford,
Heath-Brown, Huxley, Ivic, Jutila and Montgomery.

→

All these results use the large sieve and in some form the mentioned idea
of Hal´asz, which needs η
1/4. This is also the reason that they cannot
give improvements of the classical zero-density theorem of Ingham [Ing1940],
A(σ)

Recently I gave two alternative variants for proving the DH for small
values of η. In [Pin2022] the goal was to reach a possibly simple proof while
in [Pin2023] to show the strongest possible result both in speciﬁc ranges of
η < 1/12 and for η
0. Both proofs were based on Vinogradov’s method
and Hal´asz’s idea. However, in the second [Pin2023] it was important to use
recent deep results of Heath-Brown [Hea2017], further of Bourgain, Demeter
and Guth [BGD2016].

The goal of the present work is

(i) to give a possibly simple proof for all values of σ > 3/4, i.e. η < 1/4,

which

(ii) breaks the DH for the non-negligible range σ

further gives

(iv) besides the (possibly indispensable) simple idea of Hal´asz uses only
classical knowledge of the theory of Riemann’s zeta-function (classical
in the sense that known since at least hundred years).

This means that we avoid the use of Tur´an’s method, the large sieve,
Vinogradov’s method, further mean and large value theorems. However, to
break the DH we need the estimate reached by the Weyl–Hardy–Littlewood
method [Lit1922] (see also (5.15.1) of the book of Titchmarsh [Tit1951], 2nd
edition, or the paper of Landau [Lan1924]):

However, Corollary 2 yields also interesting (although already known)
consequences form small values of ℓ (ℓ = 2, 3, for example), i.e., for relatively
large ranges of η. On the other hand, they are often stronger than earlier
results proved in a more complicated way (as 11.30 of Ivic [Ivi1985], for
example).

Carlson [Car1920] or the one of Ingham [Ing1940].

“trivial” case µ(0) = 1/2 following from the functional equation).

The proof of Theorem 2 is essentially the same as that of Theorem 1. The

change is that in place of (2.5) we choose now

vℓ = vℓ(η) =: uℓ(2η) and ℓ = 0.

We remark that we can suppose η < 1/3 since otherwise 2/(1
