AN EXPLICIT VERSION OF CARLSON’S THEOREM

SHASHI CHOURASIYA

Abstract. Let N (σ, T ) denote the number of nontrivial zeros of the Riemann
zeta function with real part greater than σ and imaginary part lying between
0 and T .
In this article, we provide an explicit version of Carlson’s zero
density estimate, that is, N (σ, T ) ≤ 0.78T 4σ(1−σ)(log T )5−2σ , with a slight
improvement in the exponent of the logarithm factor.

1. Introduction

Let ζ(s) denote the Riemann zeta function and ρ denote a non-trivial zero in

the critical strip 0 < Re(s) < 1. For 1

2 ≤ σ ≤ 1 and T > 0, let

N (σ, T ) := #{ρ = β + iγ : ζ(ρ) = 0, β > σ, 0 < γ ≤ T },

where the zeta zeros are counted with multiplicities. While the Riemann hypothesis
asserts that N (σ, T ) = 0 for σ ≥ 1/2, weaker bounds of N (σ, T ) play a crucial role
in several applications of the theory of the zeros of ζ(s) such as study of primes
in short intervals. To bound N (σ, T ) is generally referred to as the zero density
estimate of ζ(s). In 2021, Platt and Trudgian [PT20] veriﬁed that N (σ, T ) = 0,
for T ≤ H0 = 3 · 1012. Consequently, we can restrict ourselves to the range of
T ≥ 3 · 1012 throughout the article.

Depending on the range of σ, various zero-density estimates exist, for instance

the ﬁrst one was provided by Bohr and Landau [BL13] in 1914, as follows:

N (σ, T ) = O

T
σ − 1

2 (cid:19)

,

(cid:18)

for T large, and Carlson then improved the bound in [Car20] to:

N (σ, T ) = O(T 4σ(1−σ) log4 T ).

In 1937, considering a bound of the zeta function on the critical line ζ
O(tc+ǫ), Ingham [Ing37] proved

N (σ, T ) = O

T (2+4c)(1−σ) log5 T

.

When σ is close to the line 1

Several non-explicit zero-density estimates are known, however, less is known
In 2014, Kadiri [KL14] provided an explicit version of
about explicit versions.
Bohr and Landau’s estimate and around the same time, Ingham’s bound (1.3) was
made explicit by Ramar´e [Ram15] and further improved by Kadiri, Lumley and Ng
[KLN18] as:

N (σ, T ) ≤ C1T

8

3 (1−σ) log5−2σ T + C2 log2 T,

(1.5)

where C1 and C2 are absolute constants depending on σ. Simoniˇc [Sim19] gave the
following explicit version of (1.4):

for some constant K2 and T ≥ 2H0. Moreover, near to the 1-line, Bellotti gave
two explicit results, one is log-free [Bel24] another one is Korobov-Vinogradov type
estimate [Bel23]. However, an explicit version of Carlson’s bound is not known yet.
The aim of this paper is to provide the ﬁrst explicit version of Carlson’s bound
in Theorem (1.1). Furthermore, some values of the constant is listed in the Table
1 while varying T0 and σ.
Theorem 1.1. For T ≥ T0 ≥ 3 · 1012 and σ ≥ 0.6, the following estimate holds:
N (σ, T ) ≤ K(σ, T0)T 4σ(1−σ) log5−2σ T,

(1.6)

(1.7)

where K(σ, T0) is deﬁned in (5.3).

Our result improves the Carlson’s estimate asymptotically as we get the exponent

5 − 2σ of log T instead of 4.

The fact that the Carlson method uses some basic techniques, will reﬂect in
the respective generalization for other L-functions as well. Some values of T0 and
K(σ, T0) are given below:

1.1. Comparison with existent estimates. Simoniˇc’s result (1.6) gives the best
bound for T ≥ 6 · 1012 and σ ∈ (1/2, 0.64). Bellotti’s two estimates are sharpest,
one for the range 3 · 1012 ≤ T ≤ exp(6.7 · 1012) when σ ∈ (0.985, 1], and the other
for T ≥ exp(6.7 · 1012) when σ ∈ (0.98, 1]. For the rest of the region in the critical
strip, the bound given by Kadiri, Lumley and Ng is the sharpest one. For Theorem
1.1, we consider the region σ ∈ [0.6, 2/3], and hence the only existing estimates we

AN EXPLICIT VERSION OF CARLSON’S THEOREM

3

need to look for the comparison are due to Simoniˇc and Kadiri, Lumley and Ng. If
we ﬁx T0 = 3 · 1012, then on comparing numerically, the Theorem 1.1 gives better
bound than (1.6) for T ≥ 9.48 · 10308 when σ ∈ [0.6, 2/3]. If we increase the value
of T0, for instance, T0 = 10200, then Theorem 1.1 becomes sharper for σ ∈ [0.6, 2/3]
and T ≥ 1.43 · 10236.

If we compare the exponents of T , Theorem 1.1 should be a better estimate than
(1.5), for σ ≤ 2/3 when T is large. However, if this method were further improved,
then there would be some scope of improvement for σ > 2/3 as well, in a ﬁnite
region.

Below is the diagram demonstrating the regions where some existing zero density

estimates including Theorem 1.1 are sharpest, for the range σ ∈ [0.5, 0.8]:

Our approach to the main theorem strongly relies on Carlson’s original proof.
The structure of this paper is as follows. In § 2, we give the classical method of
Littlewood to count the zeros. Further, in § 3, some explicit results are provided.
The key idea is to obtain a second moment of the molliﬁed zeta function in § 4,
on which this zero density estimate is heavily based. The proof of Theorem 1.1 is
given in § 5.

2. Littlewood’s classical method to count the zeros

In this section, we set up the proof for the zero density estimate. We begin with
the assumption that T is not the ordinate of a zero of zeta function. Let F (s) be
an entire function. Consider the meromorphic function h(s) = ζ(s)F (s) and
Nh(σ, T ) = #{ρ′ = β′ + iγ′ : h(ρ′) = 0, σ < β′ < 1 and 0 < γ′ < T }.

(2.1)

Let H0 = 3·1012 be deﬁned as in the previous section. Observe that, for a parameter
H ∈ (0, H0), we have N (σ, H) = 0. Subsequently, for T ≥ H0, using the fact

4

S. CHOURASIYA

N (σ, T ) ≤ Nh(σ, T ), we can write

N (σ, T ) = N (σ, T ) − N (σ, H) ≤ Nh(σ, T ) − Nh(σ, H).

On comparing to its average, we have

Nh(σ, T ) − Nh(σ, H) ≤

σ − α

α

Z

β

(Nh(τ, T ) − Nh(τ, H))dτ,

(2.2)

where β > 1 and α is a parameter satisfying 1
2 < α < σ. Here h(s) 6= 0 on σ = β
and hence the function log h(s) is regular in the neighbourhood of σ = β. Now
consider a rectangle R with vertices α + iH, β + iH, β + iT, and α + iT and apply
the classical lemma of Littlewood [Tit86], as following:

β

(Nh(τ, T ) − Nh(τ, H))dτ = −

Combining the above equation with (2.2), we write

We apply this lemma with a suitable choice of the function F (s). Here the ﬁrst
integral contributes signiﬁcantly when T is suﬃciently large. We will discuss more
about the contribution of these integrals in § 5.

3. Preliminaries lemmas

To begin with, we require some explicit estimates that involve sums over divisor
functions in diﬀerent settings. Let X ≥ X0 be a parameter which will be chosen in
terms of T later on. Let γ be the Euler’s constant.

One of the crucial elements required here is a weaker version of the approximate
functional equation for ζ(s). On choosing some speciﬁc parameters, the classical
identity is as follows:

Lemma 3.2 ([Sim19]). Let s = σ + it with σ ≥ 1/2 and t ≥ 14.1347. Then

ζ(s) =

X1≤n≤t

with |R(s)| ≤ 1.755t−σ.

Next, we prove a mean value estimate for Dirichlet polynomials that leads to an

upper bound of the ﬁrst integral in (2.4).

Let σ ≥ 0.6 and T ≥ T0 ≥ 3 · 1012. Now, consider the molliﬁer

Xn≤X

(4.1)

where µ(n) is M¨obius function. Now, let fX (s) = ζ(s)MX (s) − 1. Choose h = hX
as following:

hX (s) = 1 − f 2

X(s) = ζ(s)MX (s)(2 − ζ(s)MX (s)).

(4.2)

Observe that zeros of ζ(s) are zeros of hX (s). Here the function F (s), mentioned
in § 2, is MX(s)(2 − ζ(s)MX (s)). Now

5. Proof of Zero Density Result

The remainder of this paper will be devoted to the proof of Theorem 1.1. Now
we are in a position to bound the integrals present in (2.4) in order to get the
estimate for N (σ, T ).

From the deﬁnitions of hX and fX , we have |hX (s)| ≤ log{1 + |fX (s)|2} ≤

|fX(s)|2, so that combining it with (4.6), we get

T

log |hX (α + it)|dt ≤ C3(σ, T0)T 4σ(1−σ) log3 T,

where C3(σ, T0) is deﬁned in the previous section.

For the rest of the three integrals, we make use of some explicit results obtained
by Kadiri, Lumley, and Ng [KLN18]. To deal with the integals containing the
argument function, on setting β = 1.25 and choosing α = σ − 1
log T , we apply the
following lemma:

Lemma 5.1 ([KLN18] Lemma 4.12). Let 0 < H ≤ H0 ≤ T and X ≤ T . Let
η = 0.2561 with η0 = 0.23622 · · · , α and β satisfying 1
2 ≤ α < 1 < β ≤ 1 + η. Then,
on ﬁxing some parameters, we have

X = hT where T ≥ H0, and X0 = hH0. Then

6. Future Work

Here, the involvement of the classical approximate functional equation (3.5) as
a crucial tool makes the Carlson method less complicated than the most of the
other methods. This functional equation can be easily generalized for other L-
functions such as Dirichlet L-functions, Dedekind zeta functions, etc. One more
ingredient of this method is the Littlewood’s classical method to count the zeros
for which suﬃcient tools have been provided to generalize for Dirichlet L-functions

REFERENCES

9

by McCurley in [McC84] and for Dedekind zeta functions, by Kadiri and Ng in
[KN12]. Therefore, this method is easier to extend to other L-functions.

Titchmarsh [Tit86] made a remark about the functional equation (3.5) not being
suﬃcient for the estimation of the second moment of ζ(s). Whereas, combining (3.5)
with the mean value estimate (3.7) given by Montgomery and Vaughan yields

On the other hand, when the same functional equation is applied to obtain the

fourth moment of ζ(s) on the critical line, it gives

One can investigate a reﬁned version which is one of the main ingredients for the
zero density estimate proved by Ingham in [Ing40].
