PROLATE SPHEROIDAL OPERATOR AND ZETA

ALAIN CONNES AND HENRI MOSCOVICI

Abstract. In this paper we describe a remarkable new property of the self-
adjoint extension Wsa of the prolate spheroidal operator introduced in [1],[3].
The restriction of this operator to the interval J whose characteristic function
commutes with it is well known, has discrete positive spectrum and is well
understood [14, 15, 16, 9]. What we have discovered is that the restriction of
Wsa to the complement of J admits (besides a replica of the above positive
spectrum) negative eigenvalues whose ultraviolet behavior reproduce that of
the squares of zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Furthermore, their corre-
sponding eigenfunctions belong to the Sonin space. This feature ﬁts with the
proof [4] of Weil’s positivity at the archimedean place, which uses the compres-
sion of the scaling action to the Sonin space. As a byproduct we construct an
isospectral family of Dirac operators whose spectra have the same ultraviolet
behavior as the zeros of the Riemann zeta function.

1. Introduction

The prolate spheroidal wave functions play a key role in [2, 4, 5] in relation with the
Riemann zeta function. In all these applications they appear as eigenfunctions of
the angle operator between two orthogonal projections in the Hilbert space L2(R)ev
of even square integrable function on R. These projections depend on a parameter
λ > 0, the projection Pλ is given by the multiplication with the characteristic
function of the interval [−λ, λ] ⊂ R. The projection (cid:99)Pλ is its conjugate by the
Fourier transform FeR which is the unitary operator in L2(R)ev deﬁned by
(cid:90)

FeR(ξ)(y) =

ξ(x) exp(−2πixy)dx.

In all the above applications of prolate spheroidal wave functions the miraculous
existence, discovered by the Bell Labs group [14, 15, 16], of a diﬀerential operator
Wλ commuting with the angle operator, plays only an auxiliary role. In the present
paper we uncover another “miracle”: a careful study of the natural self-adjoint
extension of Wλ introduced in [1, Lemma 6] (see also [3, §3.3]) to L2(R) shows
that it still has discrete spectrum and that its negative eigenvalues reproduce the

conceptual reason for this coincidence is the link between the operator

(Wλξ)(x) = −∂x(λ2 − x2)∂xξ(x) + (2πλ)2x2ξ(x)
and the square of the scaling operator S := x∂x. In [4] the compression of f (S)
to Sonin’s space (for λ = 1) was shown to be the root of Weil’s positivity at the
archimedean place on test functions with support in the interval [2−1/2, 21/2], but

since Sonin’s space is not preserved by scaling, one could not restrict scaling to this
space. It turns out that Wλ commutes with the orthogonal projection on Sonin’s
space. Thus one can restrict Wλ to Sonin’s space and the ultraviolet spectral sim-
ilarity with the squares of non-trivial zeros of zeta suggests that one has spectrally
captured the contribution of the archimedean place to the mysterious zeta spec-
trum. In fact using the Darboux process we construct a Dirac square root of Wλ
depending on a deformation parameter, and whose spectrum has the same ultravi-
olet behavior as the zeros of the Riemann zeta function.

Our paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we show that there exists a unique
selfadjoint extension Wsa of the symmetric operator Wmin deﬁned on Schwartz
space S(R) by (1). Moreover Wsa commutes with Fourier transform and has discrete
spectrum unbounded in both directions. In Section 3 we show that the eigenvectors
for negative eigenvalues of Wsa belong to Sonin’s space. In Section 4 we compute
the semiclassical approximation to the number of negative eigenvalues of Wsa whose
absolute value is less than E2. In Section 5, we use the Darboux method combined
with solutions of a Riccati equation to construct an isospectral family of Dirac
operators D/ whose squares are direct sums of two copies of Wsa. In Section 6 we
2 and show that the operator 2D/ has discrete simple
specialize to the case λ =
spectrum contained in R ∪ iR with imaginary eigenvalues symmetric under complex
conjugation and counting function N (E) (counting those of positive imaginary part
less than E) fulﬁlling the same as the Riemann formula

We also show the numerical evidence for the ultraviolet spectral similarity between
the eigenvalues of 2D/ and the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Lastly, Section 7
contains more speculative ﬁnal remarks, in particular on a natural two-dimensional
black hole geometry intrinsically related to the operator 2D/ .

2. The selfadjoint prolate wave operator

The prolate spheroidal operator (1) is an operator of Sturm-Liouville type,

(Wλξ)(x) = −∂x

(cid:0)p(x)∂xξ(x)(cid:1) + q(x)ξ(x),

x ∈ R

where

p(x) = λ2 − x2,

q(x) = (2πλ)2x2,

(3)

but having two interior singular points it is not directly treatable by the usual
Sturm-Liouville theory. However its restrictions to each of the intervals (−∞, −λ),
(−λ, λ) and (λ, ∞) are standard, in fact quasi-regular, Sturm-Liouville operators.

Henceforth Wλ will be simply denoted W whenever λ is a general parameter. To
begin with, we regard W as an unbounded operator on L2(R) with core the Schwartz
space S(R). As such, W is real, symmetric and invariant under the parity exchange
x (cid:55)→ −x. These features are inherited by its closure in the graph norm Wmin, as
well as by Wmax = Wmin

∗, the latter having domain

Dom(Wmax) = {ξ ∈ L2(R) | W ξ ∈ L2(R)},
2

(4)

with W ξ viewed as a tempered distribution. In addition W has the remarkable
property of commuting with the Fourier transform

FeR (f )(y) :=

(cid:90) ∞

−∞

f (x) exp (−2πixy)dx.

(5)

Since both the Schwartz space S(R) and its dual are globally invariant under the
Fourier transform, the domains DomWmin and DomWmax are invariant too, there-
fore both Wmin and Wmax commute with FeR .

Lemma 2.1. The deﬁciency indices of Wmin are (4, 4).

Proof. Any ξ ∈ Dom(Wmax) satisfying W ξ = ±iξ is a piecewise real analytic
function and is uniquely speciﬁed by six parameters in the complement of the two
regular singular points ±λ. The known form of the solutions (cf..
[13]) together
with the fact that W ξ ∈ L2(R) imply that the logarithmic singularities of ξ on the
left and the right of ±λ have to match. This reduces the number of parameters to
4. Conversely, since all 4 singular points are LC (limit circle case), any solution of
(cid:3)
W ξ = ±iξ belongs to Dom(Wmax), hence dim Ker(Wmax ± iI) = 4.

Lemma 2.2. Let ξ ∈ DomWmax and denote a = ±λ. The distribution p(x)∂xξ
coincides with a continuous function f in a neighborhood of a and the evaluation
map L(ξ) := f (a) deﬁnes a non-zero continuous linear form on DomWmax which
vanishes on the closed subspace DomWmin.

Proof. Let V = [b, c] be a compact interval neighborhood of a = ±λ where a is the
only zero of p(x). Let ψ be the distribution ψ = p(x)∂xξ(x), one has by deﬁnition,

(cid:104)ψ | φ(cid:105) = −

(cid:90)

R

ξ(x)∂x(p(x)φ(x))dx , ∀φ ∈ S(R)

Let η = Wmaxξ, one has by deﬁnition,

(cid:104)η | φ(cid:105) = (cid:104)ξ | Wminφ(cid:105) =

(cid:90)

R

ξ(x) (∂x(p(x)∂xφ(x)) + q(x)φ(x)) dx , ∀φ ∈ S(R)

Let ξ1 ∈ L2(R) coincide with q(x)ξ(x) on V . Then for any smooth function φ with
support in V ,

(cid:104)ψ | ∂xφ(cid:105) = −

(cid:90)

R

ξ(x)∂x(p(x)∂xφ(x))dx = (cid:104)ξ1 − η | φ(cid:105)

The restriction of ξ1 − η to V belongs to L2(V ) ⊂ L1(V ) and the function f1(x) =
− (cid:82) x

b (ξ1 − η)(t)dt is continuous and fulﬁlls

(cid:90)

V

f1(x)∂xφ(x)dx = (cid:104)ξ1 − η | φ(cid:105)

It follows that (cid:104)ψ − f1 | ∂xφ(cid:105) = 0 for all smooth functions φ with support in V
and choosing a positive smooth function φ1 with support in V and integral 1, one
obtains

(cid:104)ψ | φ(cid:105) = (cid:104)f1 + s | φ(cid:105) , ∀φ ∈ C∞

c (V ), s = (cid:104)(ψ − f1) | φ1(cid:105).

Thus the distribution p(x)∂xξ coincides with the function f (x) := f1(x) + s on V .
One has

f (a) = s + f1(a) = (cid:104)(ψ − f1) | φ1(cid:105) −

(ξ1 − η)(x)dx

Moreover (cid:104)ψ | φ1(cid:105) = (cid:82) p(x)∂xξ(x)φ1(x)dx = − (cid:82) ξ(x)∂x(p(x)φ1(x))dx = (cid:104)ξ | η1(cid:105)
where η1 ∈ C∞

c (V ). One has also,

(ξ1 − η)(x)dx

= (cid:104)ξ | η2(cid:105) + (cid:104)η | η3(cid:105)
where the vectors ηj ∈ L2(R). Thus the linear form L(ξ) := f (a) is continuous
in the graph norm of DomWmax. For ξ ∈ S(R) the distribution ψ = p(x)∂xξ(x)
is a function vanishing at x = a and thus L(ξ) = 0. By the density of S(R) in
DomWmin for the graph norm, it follows that L vanishes on the closed subspace
(cid:3)
DomWmin.

Let Pλ be the cutoﬀ projection associated to the interval [−λ, λ], i.e. the multi-
plication operator by the characteristic function 1[−λ,λ], and let (cid:98)Pλ = FeR PλF−1
eR
denote its conjugate by the Fourier transform.

Lemma 2.3. If ξ ∈ DomWmin then Pλξ ∈ DomWmax and W Pλξ = PλW ξ. The
same holds with respect to (cid:98)Pλ.

Proof. Let f ∈ C∞(V ) where V is a neighborhood of the interval [−λ, λ]. Then
Pλf ∈ DomWmax and viewing W (Pλf ) as distribution one gets, for any φ ∈ S(R)

(cid:104)W (Pλf ), φ(cid:105) =

Using twice integration by parts, together with the fact that (λ2 − x2)φ(cid:48)(x) and
(λ2 − x2)f (cid:48)(x) vanish on the boundary, one obtains

(cid:104)W (Pλf ), φ(cid:105) =

W f (x)φ(x)dx,

which shows that W (Pλf ) = PλW f . In particular the same is true for any f ∈
S(R), and by the density of S(R) in DomWmin for the graph norm it follows that

ξ ∈ DomWmin =⇒ Pλξ ∈ DomWmax

and WmaxPλξ = PλW ξ.

The claim now follows from the fact that W commutes with FeR.

(cid:3)

The selfadjoint extensions of Wmin are parametrized by self-orthogonal subspaces
of E := Dom(Wmax)/Dom(Wmin) with respect to the anti-symmetric sesquilinear
form given by the pairing

Ω(ξ, η) :=

which descends to a non-degenerate form on E.

with the Lagrange identity

(9)

Passage to the lateral limits towards the endpoints of the three subintervals par-
titioning R extends this identity to the whole real line, allowing to express Ω in
terms of Lagrange brackets as follows:

iΩ(ξ, η) = [ξ, ¯η]|−λ

for all pairs ξ, η ∈ DomWmax.

+(R) ⊕ L2

Since W is invariant under parity exchange, it preserves the orthogonal decomposi-
−(R) into even, resp. odd functions, which in turn induces
tion L2(R) = L2
corresponding splittings W = W + ⊕ W −, Ω = Ω+. ⊕ Ω− and E = E+ ⊕ E−. Note
also that E± are invariant under Fourier transform.
The following auxiliary lemma will be used in the ensuing discussion.

Lemma 2.4. (i) Let f (x) = 1
2 log((λ2 − x2)−2) viewed as a tempered distribution.
Then the Fourier transform FeR f is a distribution which coincides outside 0 with
the function

(ii) Let 1I be the characteristic function of the interval I = [−λ, λ] then

(cid:101)f (y) =

cos(2πλy)
|y|

.

.

FeR 1I (y) =

sin(2πλy)
πy
Proof. (i) One has f (x) = 1
2 log((λ+x)−2), thus we start by com-
puting the Fourier transform of the distribution (cid:96) = − log(x2). One has x∂x(cid:96) = −2.
Thus one gets ∂yy(cid:98)(cid:96) = 2. Therefore y(cid:98)(cid:96) is equal to sign(y) and (cid:98)(cid:96) is the Weil princi-
pal value 1/|y|. Translation of the variable means multiplication by an imaginary
exponential in Fourier and this gives the required equality.
(ii) One has ∂x1I = δ−λ − δλ and in general FeR f (y) = 2πiy FeR f (y).

2 log((λ−x)−2)+ 1

(cid:3)

We now proceed to construct a basis of E. First, for E+ we pick an even function
c (R) such that α+(x) = log |λ2 − x2| for x ∈ [ 3
α+ ∈ C∞
4 λ] and with support
in ( 1
2 λ, 3
2 λ). Then we take β+(x) = 1I , the characteristic function of the interval
I = [−λ, λ], which belongs to PλS(R) and hence to DomWmax. Next for E− we let
α−(x) := xα+(x) and β−(x) := xβ+(x).

Lemma 2.5. The quadruplet {α±, β±, (cid:98)α±, (cid:98)β±} forms a basis of E±.

5

Proof. One checks using the expression (10) of the Ω-pairing together with Lemma
2.4 that the matrix representation of Ω+ with respect to the given quadruplet has
a single nonzero entry in each row and column.
In the odd case we note that on the one hand [α−, β−](x) = x2[α+, β+](x), and
on the other hand the derivatives involved in their Fourier transforms (cid:98)α−(x) =
2π ∂x (cid:98)α+(x), resp. (cid:98)β−(x) = i
2π ∂x (cid:98)β+(x). exchange the two functions cos and sin in
the leading terms at inﬁnity. With this observation the calculation becomes similar
(cid:3)
to that for the even case, and so is the result.

The Ω-pairings with the above basis elements yield boundary conditions of Sturm-
Liouville type. Denoting, for ξ ∈ Dom(W ±

(13)

We note that the existence of the limit deﬁning (cid:32)Lβ+(ξ), i.e. the equality of the
lateral limits, is ensured by Lemma 2.2.
Similar formulas deﬁne the functionals (cid:32)Lα− , (cid:32)Lβ− , (cid:32)L

in the odd case.

Since both Dom(Wmin) and Dom(Wmax), as well as the symplectic form Ω, are
globally invariant under the Fourier transform, the quotient inherits induced trans-

(16)

(17)

(18)

We are now in a position to establish the main result of this section.

Theorem 2.6. (i) Wsa is selfadjoint and commutes with the Fourier transform.
(ii) Wsa commutes with the projections Pλ and (cid:98)Pλ.
(iii) Wsa is the only selfadjoint extension of Wmin commuting with Pλ and (cid:98)Pλ.
(iv) The spectrum of Wsa is discrete and unbounded on both sides.

Proof. (i) Wsa is selfadjoint by construction, and its domain Lβ is invariant under
the Fourier transform also by construction.
(ii) Since DomWmin is given by (12). every element of Lβ is a linear combination
of an element ξ ∈ DomWmin and the 4 vectors β±, (cid:98)β± of Lemma 2.1. Each β± is
of the form Pλf± with f± smooth with compact support and thus one has, using
Lemma 2.3,

Pλβ± = β± ∈ S, WsaPλβ± = WsaPλf± = PλW f±,

which shows that WsaPλβ± = PλWsaPλβ± = PλWsaβ± giving the required com-
mutation for the β±.
(iii) The domain of a selfadjoint extension of Wmin commuting with Pλ and (cid:98)Pλ
must be contained in DomWmax and also contain both PλS(R) and (cid:98)PλS(R). Thus
it must contain Lβ, and cannot be larger due to self-adjointness.
(iv) The operators PλWsa and (I − Pλ)Wsa are selfadjoint on (−λ, λ), resp. on
(−∞, λ) (cid:116) (−λ, ∞), and thus covered by standard results in Sturm-Liouville the-
ory (cf.[11], [17], [9]). Indeed all four endpoints are limit circle case in the Weyl
classiﬁcation (see e.g. [17, §§5-6] for relevant deﬁnitions and properties), which can
be easily checked by using explicit bases of formal solutions for W ξ − µξ = 0,
µ ∈ C, around each singular point (cf.e.g. [13, §2]). The endpoints ±λ are LCNO
(non-oscillatory limit circle), while ±∞ are LCO (oscillatory limit circle) since the
prolate spheroidal wave functions (which provide principal solutions around ±λ)
have inﬁnitely many zeros in the neighborhood of ±∞ (cf.[14, 15, 16]). By well-
known results (cf.e.g. [11] page 90, [18]) it follows that both PλWsa and (I −Pλ)Wsa
have discrete spectrum and that the spectrum of the latter is unbounded on both
(cid:3)
sides.

Corollary 2.7. If φ is an eigenfunction of Wsa

± then

(i) φ is regular on [λ, λ + (cid:15)) and on (λ − (cid:15), λ] for some (cid:15) > 0, with a possible

discontinuity at λ;

(ii) the leading term of the asymptotic expansion of φ at ∞ is proportional to

sin(2πλx)
x

if φ is even and to cos(2πλx)

x
7

if φ is odd.

Proof. This follows from the above characterization (16), (17), (18) of the domain of
Wsa combined with the known bases of formal solutions for the equation W ξ = µξ,
(cid:3)
µ ∈ R, around ±λ and ±∞ (cf.[13]).

3. Sonin space and negative eigenvalues
We translate the requirement that the Fourier transform FeRf of an f ∈ DomWmax
has no logarithmic singularity at the singular points into a condition on the asymp-
totic behavior of f at ∞. For simplicity we only deal with even functions, and for
notational convenience take λ = 1.
We can then ﬁnd the asymptotic expansion at ∞ using the boundary condition
that the leading term there is sin(2πλy)
. We take for simplicity λ = 1 and use [13]
y
to get for the tentative eigenvector for eigenvalue µ the expansion at ∞
−µ2 + 8π2µ + 2µ − 16π4 + 8π2

(µ − 4π2)cos(2πx)

ξµ(x) ∼

sin(2πx)+0(x−4)

In fact as shown in Proposition 14 of [13], the coeﬃcients of this expansion are
directly related to the coeﬃcients of the expansion of the ﬁnite solution at λ and
taking for simplicity λ = 1, if the latter is of the form

fµ(x) =

then the asymptotic series at inﬁnity which governs the solution which has leading
term in exp(−2πix)/x is equal to v(x) exp(−2πix)/x where

(cid:88)

v(x) ∼

n!Un(µ)(2πix)−n

When one applies the Borel summation to this series the ﬁrst step is to replace it
by its Borel transform which is, up to normalization,

B(y) :=

(cid:88)

Un(µ)yn

and is related to v(x) by (cid:82) ∞

Lemma 3.1. For any µ ∈ R the asymptotic expansion of the unique solution
ξµ which at ∞ is asymptotically ∼ − sin(2πx)
is Borel summable and is equal to the
πx
Fourier transform of the unique even solution φµ which is zero on [−1, 1] and agrees
with fµ(x) for x > 1.

Proof. One has the equality

v(x)
2πix

(cid:90) ∞

exp(−2πixt)B(t)dt =

(cid:90) ∞

exp(−2πixt)fµ(t + 1)dt =

(cid:90) ∞

exp(−2πix(y − 1))fµ(y)dy

Thus one gets

v(x) exp(−2πix)/(2πix) =

(cid:90) ∞

exp(−2πixy)fµ(y)dy

The function φµ is even and vanishes on [−1, 1] so
(cid:90) ∞

(cid:90) ∞

(cid:90) ∞

exp(−2πixy)φµ(y)dy =

exp(−2πixy)fµ(y)dy+

exp(−2πixy)fµ(y)dy =

−∞

1

= v(x) exp(−2πix)/(2πix) + v(x) exp(−2πix)/(2πix)

Now these two terms are asymptotic solutions since µ is real and v(x) exp(−2πix)/(2πix)
is an asymptotic solution. Moreover the leading behavior at ∞ is in

exp(−2πix)/(2πix) − exp(2πix)/(2πix) = −

sin(2πx)
πx

Thus it follows that the Fourier transform FeR φµ = ξµ.

(cid:3)

Corollary 3.2. With the above notation, assume µ is a negative eigenvalue. Then
φµ belongs to the Sonin space.

Proof. In fact Sonin’s space is the orthogonal of the eigenspaces of Wsa associated
(cid:3)
to the classical prolate functions and their Fourier transforms.

We should note that at this point we do not claim (although this is supported by
numerical evidence) that all eigenvalues of the restriction of Wsa to Sonin’s space
are negative, however there could be only ﬁnitely many exceptions.

4. Semiclassical approximation and counting function

In this section we use the semiclassical estimate for the function counting the num-
ber of eigenvalues and investigate the negative eigenvalues of the operator Wsa. We
consider the classical Hamiltonian

Hλ(p, q) = (p2 − λ2)(q2 − λ2)

and use it as a semiclassical approximation of Wsa via the formal relation

Wλ ∼ −4π2Hλ + 4π2λ4

(19)

(20)

using the correspondence q → x and p → 1
2πi ∂x associated to the choice of the
Fourier transform FeR . Sonin’s space corresponds to the conditions p2 − λ2 ≥ 0 and
q2 − λ2 ≥ 0 and the region of interest for the counting of eigenvalues is thus

Ωλ(E) := {(q, p) | q ≥ λ, p ≥ λ, Hλ(p, q) ≤

5. Dirac operators

(24)

(25)

(cid:3)

The results of Section 4 show that for suitable values of λ the negative spectrum
of Wsa has the same ultraviolet behavior as the squares of zeros of the Riemann
zeta function. Since Wsa is a diﬀerential operator of second order we liken it to
the Klein-Gordon operator and construct the analogue of the Dirac operator. We
ﬁrst use the Darboux process (see [7], [8]) to factorize Wsa as a product of two ﬁrst
order diﬀerential operators.

Lemma 5.1. Let p(x) = x2 − λ2, V (x) = 4π2λ2x2, L = ∂(p(x)∂) + V (x),
(∇f )(x) := p(x)1/2∂f (x) and U the unitary operator

U : L2([λ, ∞), dx) → L2([λ, ∞), p(x)−1/2dx), U (ξ)(x) := p(x)1/4ξ(x).

Let w(x) be a solution of the equation

∇w(x) + w(x)2 = −V (x) +

(cid:18) p(cid:48)(cid:48)(x)
4

−

p(cid:48)(x)2
16p(x)

(cid:19)

, ∀x ∈ [λ, ∞)

(26)

then one has L = U ∗(∇ + w)(∇ − w)U .
Proof. Let f be a smooth function on R and consider the diﬀerential operators
T1 := f ∂xf and T2 := ∂xf 4∂x. Let us show that T 2
1 − T2 is an operator of order
zero: one has

1 = f ∂xf 2∂xf = −f (cid:48)f 2∂xf + ∂xf 3∂xf
T 2
−f (cid:48)f 2∂xf = −f (cid:48)2f 2 − f (cid:48)f 3∂x, ∂xf 3∂xf = ∂xf 4∂x + ∂xf 3f (cid:48)

so that T 2
p(x)1/4 gives

1 − T2 is the multiplication by 2f (cid:48)2f 2 + f 3f (cid:48)(cid:48). Applying this for f (x) =

(U ∗∇U )2 = ∂xp(x)∂x +

p(cid:48)(cid:48)(x)
4

−

p(cid:48)(x)2
16p(x)

from which the conclusion follows using (26).

(cid:3)

(27)

The next Lemma is standard using the reduction of a Riccati equation to a Bernoulli
equation.

Lemma 5.2. Let uj be two real valued solutions of Lu = 0 which generate the
linear space of solutions in (λ, ∞).
(i) For z ∈ C and u = u1 + zu2 the solution u has no zero in (λ, ∞) if z /∈ R and
an inﬁnity of zeros otherwise.
(ii) All solutions of the Riccati equation (27) are given by

wz(x) =

(x2 − λ2)1/4∂ (cid:0)(x2 − λ2)1/4u(x)(cid:1)
u(x)

(28)

where u = u1 + zu2 and z ∈ C \ R.
(iii) The map z (cid:55)→ wz from C \ R to the space of solutions of (27) is a homeomor-
phism.
Proof. (i) Let x ∈ (λ, ∞) and z ∈ C \ R, u = u1 + zu2. Assume u(x) = 0. Then
u1(x) + zu2(x) = 0 and since z ∈ C \ R this implies u1(x) = 0 and u2(x) = 0. The
Wronskian p(x)(u(cid:48)
2(x)u1(x)) is constant and non-zero since the uj are
independent solutions. Thus we get a contradiction and u has no zero. Moreover
since the equation Lu = 0 is in the LCO case any real valued solution has inﬁnitely
many zeros.
(ii) The standard solution of the Riccati equation (26) is of the form

1(x)u2(x) − u(cid:48)

w(x) =

p(x)1/4∂ (cid:0)p(x)1/4u(x)(cid:1)
u(x)

(29)

which gives

∇w(x) + w(x)2 =

p(cid:48)(cid:48)(x)
4

+

p(cid:48)(x)u(cid:48)(x)
u(x)

−

p(cid:48)(x)2
16p(x)

+

p(x)u(cid:48)(cid:48)(x)
u(x)

so that

Lu = 0 ⇒ ∇w(x) + w(x)2 = −V (x) +

(cid:18) p(cid:48)(cid:48)(x)
4

−

p(cid:48)(x)2
16p(x)

(cid:19)

Thus by (i) any wz, z ∈ C \ R is a solution of (27). Using the three values {i, −i, j}
for z and the reduction to a Bernoulli equation one can express the general solution
of (27) in the form

w = wi +

(w−i − wi)(wj − wi)
(1 − t)(wj − wi) + t (w−i − wi)

= wz(t)

(30)

where

i(i(t − 1) + j(t + 1))
i(t + 1) + j(t − 1)
(iii) The formula (30) establishes an homeomorphism between the space of solutions
of the Riccati equation and the complement in P1(C) of the circle

∈ C \ R

z(t) =

{t ∈ P1(C) | z(t) ∈ P1(R)}
and thus the map z (cid:55)→ wz from C \ R to the space of solutions of (27) is a homeo-
(cid:3)
morphism.

Proposition 5.3. Let w be a solution of the Riccati equation (27) and D/ be the
matrix of order one operators

(cid:18)

D/ =

∇ − w(x)

∇ + w(x)

(cid:19)

(cid:19)

0 L + 2∇w(x)

The proof is straightforward. The use of the Darboux process in this construction
is related to the theory of isospectral deformations [7, 8].

7. Final remarks

7.1. Geometric meaning of Theorem 6.1. The operator 2D/ of Theorem 6.1 to-
gether with the action by multiplication of smooth functions on the interval [
2, ∞)
would deﬁne a spectral triple if 2D/ were self-adjoint (or skew adjoint) but its spec-
x2 − 2(cid:1) ∂x
trum contains both real and imaginary pieces. The leading term ∇ = (cid:0)2
shows that the corresponding classical metric is (with λ =

α(x)

dx2, α(x) = −4(x2 − 2)

This ds2 changes sign when crossing the boundary x =
2 and this suggests, in
order to handle all even functions on R and to take into account the real and
imaginary eigenvalues of the square of 2D/ , to look for a two dimensional metric
with signature (−1, 1) of the form

√

ds2 = −α(x)dt2 +

√

This geometry corresponds to a black hole in two space-time dimensions with hori-
zon at x = ±

cosmological constant = 8 and no source [10]. One can look at the null curves and
this means

7.2. Positive eigenvalues of Wsa and trivial zeros of Zeta. The eigenvalues
χ(n) of the restriction of Wsa to even functions in the interval [−λ, λ] have a well
understood asymptotic form which by [12] Theorem 3.11 implies that, indepen-
dently of the value of λ, (note that we only consider even functions so that the
index n of op.cit. is replaced by 2n)

(cid:18)

χ(n) =

2n +

+ O(1), n → ∞

This behavior is the same as that of the squares of the trivial zeros of the Riemann
zeta function with the same shift of 1
2 as for the critical line. To obtain a convincing
relation one would need to analyze the extension of 2D/ to (two copies of) the even
functions on R as well as the conditioning of the Hilbert space needed to eliminate
the positive square roots of the χ(n).

7.3. Spectral truncation. In order to eliminate the real eigenvalues of 2D/ coming
from the positive eigenvalues of Wsa one can eﬀect a spectral truncation [6], the
algebra of functions acting by multiplication is then replaced by the operator system
16

obtained by compression on Sonin’s space. In a similar manner one can use spectral
truncation to eliminate the positive square roots with the notations of §7.2.
