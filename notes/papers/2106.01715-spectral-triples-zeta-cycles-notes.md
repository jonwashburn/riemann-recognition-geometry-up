### Spectral Triples and Zeta-Cycles (arXiv:2106.01715v1)

- **Citation**: Alain Connes, Caterina Consani, *Spectral Triples and Zeta-Cycles*, `arXiv:2106.01715v1` (submitted 2021-06-03; journal version cited in later work: *Enseign. Math.* 69 (2023), no. 1–2, 93–148).
- **One-line relevance**: This is the *foundational operator/quadratic-form setup* behind the later 2025 “Zeta Spectral Triples” scheme: it studies the **semilocal Weil quadratic form** \(Q_{W,\lambda}\), its near-radical, prolate vectors, and uses them to build perturbed spectral triples whose low eigenvalues numerically match low-lying zeta zeros; it also introduces **ζ-cycles** as the conceptual organizing object.

#### Results to extract (high-signal)
- **R1 (semilocal Weil quadratic form as closed lower-bounded form)**:
  - Defines the restriction \(Q_{W,\lambda}\) of the Weil sesquilinear form to \(H(\lambda)=L^2([\lambda^{-1},\lambda],d^\*u)\) and packages it as a lower-bounded, lower-semicontinuous quadratic form (hence associated to a self-adjoint operator by Kato-form theory). (Proposition 2.1 + surrounding §2.1.2)
- **R2 (map \(E\) and “near radical” / prolate vectors)**:
  - Uses the classical map \(E(f)(x)=x^{1/2}\sum_{n>0} f(nx)\) on even Schwartz functions with \(f(0)=\widehat f(0)=0\), together with the Poisson relation \(E(\widehat f)(x)=E(f)(x^{-1})\), to explain why one can build functions supported in \([\lambda^{-1},\lambda]\) that are in a **near-radical** of \(Q_{W,\lambda}\) even though RH would make the radical trivial. (Intro §1 around (1.3)–(1.5))
  - Connects this to the Slepian–Pollack theory: angle operator between time/frequency cutoffs has finitely many extremely small eigenvalues; prolate spheroidal wave functions give the “right” near-radical directions.
- **R3 (spectral triple Θ(λ,k) construction)**:
  - Defines a spectral triple \(\Theta(\lambda,k)=(A(\lambda),H(\lambda),D(\lambda,k))\) where \(D(\lambda,k)\) is a finite-rank perturbation of the standard Dirac \(D_0=-iu\partial_u\) by compressing away from the span of (k+2) prolate-derived vectors. (Definition around (1.5), Proposition 4.1)
- **R4 (zeta zeros from eigenvalues; ζ-cycles)**:
  - Develops criteria (Sections 5–6) under which eigenvalues of \(D(\lambda,k)\) coincide with imaginary parts of zeta zeros, and introduces **ζ-cycles** as the conceptual device explaining the “special values of \(\lambda\)” where matching occurs.
  - States and proves a main theorem about ζ-cycles (Theorem 1.1 referenced in intro; see Section 6).

#### Assumptions / caveats
- **A1 (operator-theoretic program, not a proof of RH)**: The paper provides numerical evidence and an operator framework; it does not close the “convergence ⇒ RH” gap.
- **A2 (sensitivity to prime contributions)**: The semilocal Weil form positivity is highly sensitive to including the correct prime-power contributions; they show positivity can fail if one ignores contributions once \(\lambda^2\) crosses prime powers (intro §1, §2.4).

#### Mapping to our framework (written + Lean)
- **Route 3 operator targets**:
  - This paper is a strong conceptual match to our `OperatorSpectralMeasureBridge.lean` story:
    - “quadratic form ⇒ self-adjoint operator” aligns with `OperatorQuadraticIdentity`/`OperatorSesqIdentity`.
    - the “quotient by radical” language matches the GNS/quotient mechanics in `HilbertRealization.lean`.
- **How it could help the written proof**:
  - Offers an alternate RH program: prove convergence of the operator/determinant approximants (later formalized in `arXiv:2511.22755`) rather than proving the PSC splice identity.
- **Lean integration**:
  - No immediate Lean hole is discharged, but it motivates adding a typed “Hurwitz/convergence gate” target for Route‑3′ (approximants with real zeros converging to `riemannXi` ⇒ RH).

#### Verdict
- **High-value foundational context** for the Connes/Consani/Moscovici operator route; not directly closing current PSC/ContourToBoundary axioms, but it clarifies what the “missing step” would look like and why the prolate/near-radical phenomenon is central.
