### Kato Euler system (one-sided divisibility) — BSD audit notes

- **Citation**: Kato (2004) + standard expositions (Skinner–Urban, Rubin, etc.).
- **One-line relevance**: this is the paper’s “B1′” input; it supplies the divisibility \(\mathrm{char}_\Lambda(X_p)\mid (L_p)\) (ordinary/signed variants as applicable).

#### Results to extract
- **R1 (ordinary divisibility)**: Kato’s theorem giving the one-sided inclusion of characteristic ideals / Fitting ideals (or divisibility of \(p\)-adic \(L\)-function by the characteristic power series of the Selmer dual), under explicit hypotheses.
- **R2 (signed / supersingular formulation)**: how to state the signed one-sided divisibility (if needed), and what additional hypotheses are required.

#### Mapping to the proof track
- `B1'`
- `prop:mu-zero`, `prop:BSDp`
- operator model “reverse divisibility” packaging (`prop:Hlambda-to-revdiv`) relies on having at least this one-sided divisibility available somewhere.
