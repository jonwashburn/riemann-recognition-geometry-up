### Supersingular signed theory (Pollack/Kobayashi/LLZ) — BSD audit notes

- **Citation**:
  - Pollack (2003) \(\log^\pm\)
  - Kobayashi (2003) \(\pm\)-Selmer groups
  - Lei–Loeffler–Zerbes (2012) Wach-module / signed Coleman maps refinements
- **One-line relevance**: supplies the signed analogues used throughout Appendix F.17/F.24 (`thm:HL-signed`, `lem:triang-signed`, signed IMC references).

#### Results to extract
- **R1**: definition of \(\log^\pm\) and their integrality/unit linear term (precise normalization).
- **R2**: definition of signed local conditions and the identification with kernels of signed Coleman maps at finite-order χ.
- **R3**: signed explicit reciprocity linking \(\mathcal{L}_V\) and signed Bloch–Kato maps (unit factors).
- **R4**: any signed control theorems needed for global arguments.

#### Mapping to the proof track
- `thm:HL-signed`, `lem:PR-signed-proof`, `lem:HL-signed-nullspace`, `lem:triang-signed`, `lem:diag-units-signed`
