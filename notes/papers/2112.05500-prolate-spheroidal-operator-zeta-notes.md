### Prolate spheroidal operator and Zeta (arXiv:2112.05500v1)

- **Citation**: Alain Connes, Henri Moscovici, *Prolate spheroidal operator and Zeta*, `arXiv:2112.05500v1` (submitted 2021-12-10). (This is the preprint underlying the later “UV prolate spectrum matches the zeros of zeta” storyline cited in 2023–2025 Connes-chain papers.)
- **One-line relevance**: Supplies concrete operator theory around the **self-adjoint prolate wave operator** and its **negative spectrum**, showing its ultraviolet spectral statistics match the squares of zeta zeros and connecting eigenfunctions to the **Sonin space** (which is the archimedean Weil-positivity setting).

#### Results to extract (high-signal)
- **R1 (self-adjoint extension with discrete spectrum on both sides)**:
  - Constructs a unique self-adjoint extension \(W_{\mathrm{sa}}\) of the prolate spheroidal operator \(W_\lambda\) acting on \(L^2(\mathbb R)\), commuting with Fourier transform and with discrete spectrum unbounded above and below. (Theorem 2.6)
- **R2 (negative eigenfunctions live in Sonin space)**:
  - Shows the eigenvectors for negative eigenvalues belong to the Sonin space (after fixing parity / λ in their discussion). (Section 3 headline)
- **R3 (semiclassical counting of negative eigenvalues)**:
  - Computes the semiclassical approximation to the number of negative eigenvalues with \(|\alpha|\le E^2\) (via elliptic integrals / asymptotics). (Proposition 4.2 + surrounding Section 4)
- **R4 (Dirac square root and zeta-like counting law)**:
  - Builds a Dirac-type first-order operator whose square is essentially two copies of \(W_{\mathrm{sa}}\) (Darboux / Riccati deformation). (Proposition 5.3)
  - In the special case \(\lambda=\sqrt2\), proves the Dirac operator \(2\\slashed D\) has discrete simple spectrum contained in \(\mathbb R \cup i\mathbb R\), and its imaginary-eigenvalue counting function satisfies the same leading asymptotic as the Riemann zero counting function:
    \[
      N(E) \sim \frac{E}{2\pi}\Big(\log\!\frac{E}{2\pi}-1\Big) + O(1).
    \]
    (Theorem 6.1)

#### Assumptions / caveats
- **A1 (UV-statistics, not exact zero identification)**: The core theorems are about **spectral statistics / asymptotics**, not an exact equality “spectrum = zeta zeros” or a convergence theorem of approximants to \(\Xi\).
- **A2 (parameter sensitivity)**: The “matching” phenomenon is tied to special parameter choices (notably \(\lambda=1\) and \(\lambda=\sqrt2\) for their coincidences).

#### Mapping to our blockers / Lean architecture
- **Route 3′ (Connes determinant approximants)**:
  - This paper provides the operator-theoretic backdrop for why prolate/Sonin operators plausibly encode the archimedean explicit-formula contribution.
  - It supports the narrative in `arXiv:2310.18423` and the later 2025 “Zeta Spectral Triples” program, but it does not itself prove the missing **determinant convergence to `Ξ`**.
- **Lean touchpoints**:
  - Best viewed as motivation/support for the Connes Route‑3′ pipeline now packaged in:
    - `RiemannRecognitionGeometry/ExplicitFormula/HurwitzGate.lean`
    - `RiemannRecognitionGeometry/ExplicitFormula/ConnesHurwitzBridge.lean`
  - If we ever formalize the prolate operator itself, the natural Lean targets would look like:
    - “self-adjoint operator + spectral counting asymptotics” (operator analysis),
    - “eigenfunctions in Sonin space” (function-space identification).
    That is far beyond current Route‑3 Lean holes, so for now this paper is **conceptual support**.

#### Verdict
- **Support / foundational** for the Connes prolate approach (explains why the UV spectrum looks like zeta zeros and why Sonin space is central).
- **Not a direct discharge** of current Lean proof holes (PSC splice identity; or RG B1/B2′), but strengthens the written-proof plausibility of Route‑3′.
