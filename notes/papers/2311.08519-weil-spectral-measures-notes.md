### (arXiv:2311.08519v1) — “A probabilistic interpretation of Weil’s explicit sums and arithmetic spectral measures”

- **Citation**: *A probabilistic interpretation of Weil’s explicit sums and arithmetic spectral measures*, arXiv:2311.08519v1 (authors not reliably captured by PDF text extraction; can be read from the arXiv page if needed).
- **Primary relevance**: **Route 3 (spectral measure / reflection-positivity flavor)**. This paper explicitly rewrites (truncated) Weil explicit sums as **quadratic forms of self-adjoint operators** and then as **integrals against spectral measures**.

### What the paper actually proves (key statements)

#### Theorem 5 (operator realization on a Hilbert space)
There exists a bounded linear operator \(W_p\) on a Hilbert space \(L^2(B)\) (Bohr compactification framework) such that a quadratic form built from \(W_p\) matches a covariance / Weil-sum expression (paper’s notation around equations (14)–(15)).

The big conceptual point: **Weil explicit sums become quadratic forms** \(\langle W F, F\rangle\) on a concrete Hilbert space.

#### Theorem 7 (finite-prime truncation ⇒ spectral integral)
For a finite set \(I\subset \mathcal P\) of primes, they define a bounded self-adjoint operator \(W_I\) (a multiplication operator in their construction). Then for test functions \(f\in C_I\),
the **finite Weil sum** can be expressed as a **spectral integral**:
\[
W_{\mathrm{fin}}\!\big(f^\ast f^\ast\big)\;=\;\int_{\sigma(W_I)} \lambda\ d w_I(\lambda, M_{\mathrm{fin}}(f)),
\]
where \(d w_I\) is the projection-valued spectral measure of \(W_I\), and the scalar measure
\(d w_I(\cdot, F)\) is the usual \( \langle F, dw_I(\cdot)F\rangle\) construction.

#### Theorem 9 (archimedean completion as a limit of spectral measures)
For the “full” Weil sum, they introduce a \(q\)-deformation \(W_{I,q}\) and prove a limit formula:
\[
W\!\big(f^\ast f^\ast\big)\;=\;\lim_{q\to 1}\int_{\sigma(W_{I,q})} \lambda\ d w_{I,q}(\lambda, f),
\]
where the measure \(d w_{I,q}(\cdot,f)\) depends on \(f\) and \(q\).

#### Remark (Burnol/Haran covariance strategy)
They explicitly connect to the “covariance realization” idea (Burnol/Haran style):
construct random variables \(X_f\) with covariance \(\mathrm{Cov}(X_f,X_g)\) equal (up to sign) to the Weil pairing \(W(f^\ast g^\ast)\), making RH equivalent to positivity/variance statements.

### Mapping to our written/Lean blockers

#### Why this is Route 3–relevant
Our Route 3 Lean target is exactly a statement of the form:
- **(measure-first)** `SesqMeasureIdentity` / `SesqMeasureIntegralIdentity`:
  \[
  W^{(1)}(\mathrm{pair}(f,g)) \;=\; \langle F_f, F_g\rangle_{L^2(\mu)}
  \]
  for some spectral measure \(\mu\), or
- **(reflection positivity)** a Hilbert-space realization of the Weil pairing.

This paper provides a *concrete operator-theoretic mechanism* that yields:
- quadratic forms \(\langle W F, F\rangle\),
- and therefore spectral integrals against a measure (by the spectral theorem).

So it’s extremely aligned with the *shape* of the missing “splice-completion spectral identity”.

#### What remains missing (core gap)
- The paper works with a specific adelic/probabilistic framework and a particular class of test functions; mapping **exactly** to our `LagariasFramework` and to the PSC/J(s) splice chain still requires substantial translation.
- The RH-level content is still RH-equivalent (it’s another formulation of Weil’s criterion), not a new unconditional breakthrough.

### Actionable extraction (how it can help anyway)

- **Target shaping for Lean**:
  - suggests adding an “operator/spectral theorem” intermediate target:
    `∃ (H) (W : H →L[ℂ] H) selfAdjoint, ...` + a transform `f ↦ F_f ∈ H`
    such that \(W(f^\ast f^\ast)=\langle W F_f, F_f\rangle\).
  - by spectral theorem, this immediately implies a measure representation, matching `SesqMeasureIntegralIdentity`.
- **Written proof**:
  - supports a “probabilistic / covariance” framing of reflection positivity, consistent with our `ReflectionPositivityRealization` packaging.

---

### Verdict

- **Very relevant** as a modern reference for “Weil explicit sum = spectral measure integral”.
- **Not directly discharging** the Route 3 splice identity in our current PSC/J(s) formulation, but suggests alternate intermediate targets that may be more natural to formalize in Lean.
