### Zeta Spectral Triples (arXiv:2511.22755v1)

- **Citation**: Alain Connes, Caterina Consani, Henri Moscovici, *Zeta Spectral Triples*, `arXiv:2511.22755v1` (submitted 2025-11-27).
- **One-line relevance**: This is the first paper in our search that proposes a **concrete, finite-primes operator scheme** whose eigenvalues numerically converge to the low-lying zeta zeros, with a clear “missing step = prove determinant convergence ⇒ RH” gap that can be stated as a typed intermediate target.

#### What the paper actually proves (high-signal theorem shapes)
- **R1 (finite-primes / finite-dimensional truncation of Weil form)**:
  - For each \(\lambda>1\), restrict the Weil quadratic form \(Q_W\) to \(L^2([\lambda^{-1},\lambda],d^\*u)\) to get a “semilocal” form \(Q_{W,\lambda}\).
  - Further restrict to a finite-dimensional subspace \(E_N(\lambda)\) spanned by the \(2N+1\) lowest-frequency eigenfunctions of the scaling operator \(D_{\log}(\lambda)\) (periodic b.c.), producing a matrix form \(Q^N_{W,\lambda}\).
  - The construction involves only Euler products over primes \(p\le x=\lambda^2\) (i.e. “finite primes” data).
- **R2 (rank-one perturbed scaling operator; self-adjointness via quadratic form)**:
  - Under a “simple-even” hypothesis (smallest eigenvalue \(\varepsilon_N\) of \(Q^N_{W,\lambda}\) is simple and eigenvector \(\xi\) is even under \(u\mapsto u^{-1}\), normalized by a Dirichlet-kernel vector \(\delta_N(\xi)=1\)),
  - they define a rank-one perturbation \(D_{\log}(\lambda,N)\) of the scaling operator \(D_{\log}(\lambda)\),
  - and prove it is **self-adjoint** with respect to the inner product induced by the shifted quadratic form \(Q^N_{W,\lambda}-\varepsilon_N\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle\). (Theorem 1.1(i))
- **R3 (regularized determinant → entire function with real zeros)**:
  - They compute a regularized determinant \(\det_{\mathrm{reg}}(D_{\log}(\lambda,N)-z)\) and show it equals (up to an explicit scalar factor) the Fourier transform \(\widehat{\xi}(z)\) of the minimal eigenvector \(\xi\). (Theorem 1.1(ii))
  - Conclude: \(\widehat{\xi}\) is entire and **all its zeros are real**, coinciding with the spectrum of \(D_{\log}(\lambda,N)\). (Theorem 1.1(iii))
  - This is the rigorous reason the “approximant zeros lie exactly on the critical line.”
- **R4 (numerical convergence claim; strategy, not proven)**:
  - Numerical experiments show the spectrum of \(D_{\log}(\lambda,N)\) converges to the low-lying zeros of \(\zeta(1/2+is)\) as \(N,\lambda\to\infty\) (Section 6).
  - They outline a strategy: prove convergence of the normalized determinants \(\det_{\mathrm{reg}}(D_{\log}(\lambda,N)-z)\) to the Riemann \(\Xi\)-function (Section 7–8). A rigorous proof of this convergence would imply RH (via Hurwitz).

#### The “missing step” stated very concretely (Section 7, Outlook)
The paper’s Outlook spells out a two-stage convergence target:

- **Stage A (fixed \(\lambda\), \(N\to\infty\))**:
  - For fixed \(\lambda\), the determinants \(\det_{\mathrm{reg}}(D_{\log}(\lambda,N)-s)\) converge as \(N\to\infty\) to an explicit entire function of \(s\), of the form
    \[
    -i\,\lambda^{-is}\,\widehat{\xi_\lambda}(s),
    \]
    where \(\xi_\lambda\) is the lowest-eigenvalue eigenfunction of \(Q_{W,\lambda}\), normalized by \(\xi_\lambda(\lambda)=1\).
  - The text indicates convergence **uniformly on compact subsets** of \(\mathbb C\) in this stage.

- **Stage B (\(\lambda\to\infty\))**:
  - As \(\lambda\to\infty\), the functions \(\widehat{\xi_\lambda}(s)\), after multiplying by a suitable scalar factor \(e^{a+ibs}\), converge **uniformly on closed substrips** of the open strip \(|\Im(s)|<1/2\) to Riemann’s
    \[
    \Xi(s) = \xi(1/2 + i s),
    \qquad
    \xi(z)=\tfrac12 z(z-1)\pi^{-z/2}\Gamma(z/2)\zeta(z).
    \]
  - This would imply RH by a Hurwitz “zeros under uniform limits” argument, since the approximants have only real zeros by the self-adjointness mechanism.

#### What Section 8 says are the *two essential missing steps*
The paper is unusually explicit about what remains unproved:

- **M1 (simple-even for the Weil quadratic form \(Q_{W,\lambda}\))**:
  - To apply their “real zeros from self-adjointness” theorem (their Theorem 5.10), they need:
    - the **smallest eigenvalue** of the Weil quadratic form \(Q_{W,\lambda}\) to be **simple**, and
    - the corresponding eigenvector \(\xi_\lambda\) to be **even**.
  - (They note this “simple-even” condition holds for the prolate-wave operator \(PW_\lambda\), but not yet proved for \(Q_{W,\lambda}\).)

- **M2 (prove the educated guess \(k_\lambda\) approximates \(\xi_\lambda\))**:
  - Their proposed \(k_\lambda := E(h_\lambda)\) uses the prolate-wave operator eigenfunctions \(h_{0,\lambda}, h_{4,\lambda}\),
    with \(h_\lambda\) the unique normalized linear combination with vanishing integral.
  - The missing step is to prove \(k_\lambda\) is a sufficiently accurate approximation (up to scalar) of the true Weil ground state \(\xi_\lambda\),
    so that the convergence of \(\widehat{\xi_\lambda}\) (hence determinant convergence) can be justified rigorously.

#### Lemma 7.3 is *not* the hard part (but it clarifies the topology)
They prove (under the prolate approximation estimates) the analytic/topological portion:

- If \(\delta(\lambda) := \max_{x\in[-\lambda,\lambda]} |h_\lambda(x)-h(x)|\) satisfies \(\delta(\lambda)=O(\lambda^{-2})\),
  then the Fourier transform of \(k_\lambda=E(h_\lambda)\) converges to \(\Xi\) **uniformly on closed substrips**
  of the open strip \(|\Im(z)|<1/2\).

So the remaining “RH-hard” content is precisely the comparison \(k_\lambda \approx \xi_\lambda\) and the simple-even gate for \(Q_{W,\lambda}\).

#### Concrete formulas (Section 7 “Outlook”, exact shapes)
From the paper’s Section 7 (Outlook), the objects used in the intended convergence proof are:

- **Riemann’s classical kernel**:
  - \(k(u) = E(h)(u)\)
  - \(E(f)(u) := u^{1/2}\sum_{n\ge 1} f(nu)\)
  - \(h\) is a specific even Schwartz function (their Eq. (7.1)), characterized via the **harmonic oscillator** eigenfunctions \(h_0,h_4\) by vanishing integral (Lemma 7.1).

- **Prolate-wave “educated guess”**:
  - prolate wave operator \(PW_\lambda\) (their Eq. (7.5))
  - eigenfunctions \(h_{n,\lambda}\) with the same parity/Fourier-symmetry labels as Hermite functions
  - \(h_\lambda\) = (normalized) linear combination of \(h_{0,\lambda},h_{4,\lambda}\) with vanishing integral
  - **educated guess** \(k_\lambda := E(h_\lambda)\) on \([\,\lambda^{-1},\lambda\,]\) (their Eq. (7.6))

- **Key quantitative input used by Lemma 7.3**:
  - a uniform sup bound \(\max_{x\in[-\lambda,\lambda]}|h_\lambda(x)-h(x)| \le c\,\lambda^{-2}\) (their Eq. (7.8), sourced to Meixner–Schäfke).

#### Assumptions / caveats (what’s conditional / missing)
- **A1 (simple-even hypothesis)**: A key technical gate is the “simple-even” condition (simplicity of the smallest eigenvalue of the truncated Weil form + evenness of the eigenvector). The paper treats this as a condition to verify; it is not proven uniformly in \((\lambda,N)\).
- **A2 (main RH step is still open)**: The crucial implication “approximants converge to \(\Xi\) ⇒ RH” is standard (Hurwitz), but the **analytic convergence** of determinants / eigenvalues is the deep missing step.
- **A3 (uses external tool [7])**: Self-adjointness and real-zero statements rely on an extension of Carathéodory–Fejér theory for Toeplitz matrices, cited as [7] (Connes–van Suijlekom, 2025; see separate deep dive).

#### Mapping to our blockers / architecture
- **Route 3 splice identity blocker (PSC/J(s))**:
  - This paper does **not** directly prove the PSC “measure-first splice identity.”
  - Instead it proposes an alternative Route‑3′: build *approximant entire functions* (via determinants of finite-prime operators) whose zeros are on the critical line and prove they converge to \(\Xi\).
- **How this could help the written proof**:
  - It supplies a clean “finite primes → operator → zeros on line” mechanism, aligning with Weil’s “finite-primes positivity” philosophy.
  - It reframes the hard analytic step as: **prove determinant convergence** (rather than prove the PSC spectral identity).
- **Lean touchpoints**:
  - **Operator/quotient mechanics** already match our existing Route‑3 scaffolding:
    - `RiemannRecognitionGeometry/ExplicitFormula/HilbertRealization.lean` (quotient by radical / completion)
    - `RiemannRecognitionGeometry/ExplicitFormula/OperatorSpectralMeasureBridge.lean` (operator-form targets)
  - **New Lean targets suggested**:
    - a “Hurwitz-style” intermediate gate: a sequence of entire functions with **real zeros** converging locally-uniformly to \(\Xi\) on the strip \(|\Im|<1/2\) implies “\(\Xi\) has only real zeros in the strip”, hence RH.
      - implemented as a typed target: `RiemannRecognitionGeometry/ExplicitFormula/HurwitzGate.lean` (`HurwitzOffRealAxisInStripGate`)
    - a finite-dimensional “truncated Weil form + rank-one perturbation” packaging (optional, if we want to mirror Theorem 1.1).
    - **(New)** we sharpened CCM’s Section 8 “missing steps” into **Lean-facing typed surfaces** (still axiomatic, but now minimally ambiguous):
      - `RiemannRecognitionGeometry/ExplicitFormula/ConnesConvergenceBundle.lean`
        - `ConnesMissingStepSimpleEven` (M1: ground state exists / even / simple, normalized by `ξ_λ(λ)=1`)
        - `ConnesMissingStep_kλ_approximates_ξλ` (M2: uniform-on-`[λ⁻¹,λ]` approximation `k_λ ≈ c_λ ξ_λ` with error → 0)

#### Verdict (does it discharge anything today?)
- **Best case**: reshapes the Route‑3 program into a more concrete analytic target (“determinant convergence”), and gives strong numerical evidence plus a well-specified set of intermediate hypotheses (simple-even + convergence).
- **Worst case**: still RH-hard; may be a powerful heuristic / research program rather than a near-term discharge of current Lean axioms.
- **Net**: **High-value new direction**; not a direct closure of existing PSC/ContourToBoundary axioms, but offers an alternate typed “bridge” candidate that’s plausibly easier to formalize once convergence lemmas are in place.
