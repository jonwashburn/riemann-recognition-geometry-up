### Pintz (arXiv:2310.04544) — “A remark on density theorems for Riemann’s zeta-function”

- **Citation**: János Pintz, *A remark on density theorems for Riemann’s zeta-function*, arXiv:2310.04544.
- **Primary relevance**: **B2′ funnel (marginal/support)**; mostly reframes/derives families of density bounds, including conditional consequences of Lindelöf.

### What the paper actually proves (as extracted)

This paper discusses classical and conditional density theorems for zeta zeros and derives families of explicit consequences.

#### Theorem 1 (family of bounds; parametrized by \(\ell,\eta\))
The statement is given in terms of a function \(B(\eta)\) and auxiliary functions \(u_\ell(\eta), v_\ell(\eta)\) (see the paper’s notation).
Roughly: for \(\ell\ge 1\) and \(\eta\) in a certain range, one obtains an inequality of the form
\[
B(\eta) \le \max\{4u_\ell(\eta),\,3v_\ell(\eta)\},
\]
and then deduces explicit density theorems (Corollaries 2–6).

#### Corollary 1 (conditional; Lindelöf ⇒ very strong density in a right-hand range)
Under Lindelöf, the paper states a strong density consequence for \(\sigma>3/4\) (essentially \(N(\sigma,T)\ll_\varepsilon T^\varepsilon\) in that range).

### Mapping to our framework

- This is primarily about **right-side** density statements (near \(\Re(s)=1\) and/or \(\Re(s)>3/4\)).
- In our μ-Carleson/B2′ story, these regimes correspond to **large** \(\sigma'=\beta-1/2\), which are not expected to be the hard part.

### Can this discharge a blocker?

#### Best-case use
- As a **support reference** when carving the analysis into regimes:
  - “far-right zeros are sparse/controlled (conditionally or by known theorems)”.

#### What remains missing
- Does not provide a concrete route to the **near-critical-line** packing/BMO controls required by:
  - `MuCarleson` for the σ-weighted measure in *all* Whitney/Carleson boxes,
  - `OscillationTargetTail` in Lean.

---

### Actionable extraction

- Mostly useful as **context/citation** in the written manuscript for discussing how existing density technology behaves and what conditional hypotheses imply.
- Not an obvious candidate for a Lean-facing assumption unless we explicitly add a “Lindelöf ⇒ …” conditional branch.

---

### Verdict

- **Background/support** rather than a direct tool for current Lean/written blockers.
