- **Citation**: Terence Tao, Tim S. Trudgian, Andrew Yang, *New exponent pairs, zero density estimates, and zero additive energy estimates: a systematic approach*, arXiv:2501.16779.
- **Primary relevance**:
  - **B2′ / μ-Carleson (indirect)**: gives systematic best-known *exponents* for zero density and (new) **additive energy** of zeros, which is closer in spirit to “packing/structure control”.
  - Provides a curated database workflow (ANTEDB) that is useful for keeping the deep-dive plan current.

### What the paper actually proves (key statements)

#### Definition 37 (zero density exponent \(A(\sigma)\))
Let \(N(\sigma,T)\) be the number of zeta zeros \(\rho\) with \(\Re(\rho)\ge \sigma\) and \(|\Im(\rho)|\le T\).
For fixed \(1/2 \le \sigma < 1\), the **zero density exponent** \(A(\sigma)\) is the infimum of exponents \(A\) such that:
- for every \(\varepsilon>0\), there exist constants \(C,\delta>0\) with
  \[
  N(\sigma-\delta,T) \le C\,T^{A(1-\sigma)+\varepsilon}
  \]
  for all \(T\) sufficiently large.

They highlight the **Density Hypothesis**:
\[
A(\sigma)\le 2 \quad\text{for all } 1/2\le \sigma < 1.
\]

#### Table 2 (best known upper bounds on \(A(\sigma)\))
The PDF extraction does not preserve the numeric table, but the paper states that Table 2 records the current best upper bounds, marking new improvements.
This is a “where to look for state-of-the-art exponents” resource.

#### Definition 56 (additive-energy zero density exponent \(A^*(\sigma)\))
They define an additive-energy analogue:
- \(N^*(\sigma,T)\) is the **additive energy** (Definition 7) of the imaginary parts of zeros with \(\Re(\rho)\ge\sigma\), \(|\Im(\rho)|\le T\).
- \(A^*(\sigma)\) is the infimum of exponents \(A^*\) such that
  \[
  N^*(\sigma-\delta,T) \ll T^{A^*(1-\sigma)+o(1)}.
  \]
They note rough inequalities:
\[
2A(\sigma)\le A^*(\sigma)\le 3A(\sigma),
\]
reflecting the trivial \(|W|^2 \ll E_1(W)\ll |W|^3\) bounds on additive energy.

#### Theorem 64 (new additive energy estimates; explicit piecewise bounds)
For fixed \(7/10 \le \sigma < 1\), they give **explicit piecewise rational bounds** on \(A^*(\sigma)(1-\sigma)\) across several subintervals of \(\sigma\).

The PDF text extraction *does* preserve the theorem statement. The bounds are of the form
\[
A^*(\sigma)(1-\sigma)\le \max(\text{several rational functions in }\sigma),
\]
with different max-expressions on different σ-subintervals. Concretely (as stated in the paper):

- (i) For \(3/4 \le \sigma \le 5/6\),
  \[
  A^*(\sigma)(1-\sigma)\le \max\!\left(\frac{18-19\sigma}{2(3\sigma-1)},\ \frac{4(10-9\sigma)}{5(4\sigma-1)}\right).
  \]
- (ii) For \(7/10 \le \sigma \le 3/4\),
  \[
  A^*(\sigma)(1-\sigma)\le \max\!\left(\frac{5(18-19\sigma)}{2(5\sigma+3)},\ \frac{2(45-44\sigma)}{2\sigma+15}\right).
  \]
- (iii) For \(173/229 \le \sigma \le 443/586\),
  \[
  A^*(\sigma)(1-\sigma)\le \max\!\left(\frac{173-270\sigma}{16(93-125\sigma)},\ \frac{653-890\sigma}{10(93-125\sigma)},\ \frac{1151-1190\sigma}{20(15\sigma-2)}\right).
  \]
- (iv) For \(443/586 \le \sigma \le 373/493\),
  \[
  A^*(\sigma)(1-\sigma)\le \max\!\left(\frac{593-810\sigma}{5(171-230\sigma)},\ \frac{4(266-275\sigma)}{5(55\sigma-7)}\right).
  \]
- (v) For \(373/493 \le \sigma \le 103/136\),
  \[
  A^*(\sigma)(1-\sigma)\le \max\!\left(\frac{533-730\sigma}{30(26-35\sigma)},\ \frac{3(26-33\sigma)}{85\sigma-62},\ \frac{174-185\sigma}{31\sigma+2}\right).
  \]
- (vi) For \(103/136 \le \sigma \le 42/55\),
  \[
  A^*(\sigma)(1-\sigma)\le \max\!\left(\frac{72-91\sigma}{7(11\sigma-8)},\ \frac{5(18-19\sigma)}{2(5\sigma+3)}\right).
  \]
- (vii) For \(42/55 \le \sigma \le 79/103\),
  \[
  A^*(\sigma)(1-\sigma)\le \frac{18-19\sigma}{6(15\sigma-11)}.
  \]
- (viii) For \(79/103 \le \sigma \le 84/109\),
  \[
  A^*(\sigma)(1-\sigma)\le \max\!\left(\frac{18-19\sigma}{2(37\sigma-27)},\ \frac{3(18-19\sigma)}{4(4\sigma-1)},\ \frac{5(18-19\sigma)}{2(13\sigma-3)}\right).
  \]
- (ix) For \(84/109 \le \sigma \le 5/6\),
  \[
  A^*(\sigma)(1-\sigma)\le \max\!\left(\frac{18-19\sigma}{9(3\sigma-2)},\ \frac{4(10-9\sigma)}{5(4\sigma-1)}\right).
  \]

This is (importantly) **more concrete than “\(o(1)\)” density statements**: it gives fixed rational functions, which is closer to the kind of fixed-constant inequalities we ultimately want to feed into a Lean-facing assumption surface (even if the bridge from global energy to local Carleson is still missing).

---

### Mapping to our framework (Lean + manuscript)

#### Why additive energy is “closer” to μ-Carleson than plain zero density
Our B2′/μ-Carleson bottleneck is fundamentally **local + geometric** (Carleson boxes over Whitney bases).
Plain \(N(\sigma,T)\) bounds are *global* in height.

Additive energy, while still global, contains information about **structure and clustering** of zero ordinates:
- high energy signals many additive coincidences among ordinates,
- low energy suggests pseudo-randomness / lack of additive structure.

This is conceptually closer to a “packing” statement than bare counts.

---

### Can this discharge a blocker?

#### Best-case use
- As a **design input**: suggests that an attack on μ-Carleson/B2′ might use “energy-of-zeros” type inputs rather than only \(N(\sigma,T)\).
- If we can relate μ-Carleson to bounds on local additive energy in Whitney windows, Theorem 64 could become a relevant “number theory input”.

#### What remains missing (core gap)
- No immediate route from asymptotic exponents \(A(\sigma), A^*(\sigma)\) to the **uniform, local** predicate
  `MuCarleson μ Cμ α` in Lean.
- The paper largely works at the exponent/\(o(1)\) level, whereas our Lean-facing statements want **fixed constants** and clean inequalities.

---

### Actionable extraction for us

- **Written proof**:
  - use this paper as the best modern reference for “what zero-density technology can plausibly deliver today” (especially via energy).
  - if we pursue a new lemma “(local) energy control ⇒ μ-Carleson”, this becomes a natural input citation.
- **Lean**:
  - consider adding an intermediate predicate capturing an “energy bound for zeros in windows”, and keep `MuCarleson` as the downstream target.

---

### Verdict

- **High-value strategic paper**: clarifies the state of the art and points toward energy-based structure controls.
- **Not a direct plug-in** to any current Lean proof-hole, but strongly informs how to reshape the B2′ attack into smaller lemmas.
