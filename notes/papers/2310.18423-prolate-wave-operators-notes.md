### Zeta zeros and prolate wave operators (arXiv:2310.18423v2)

- **Citation**: Alain Connes, Caterina Consani, Henri Moscovici, *Zeta zeros and prolate wave operators: Semilocal adelic operators*, `arXiv:2310.18423v2` (submitted 2023-10-27). (Published version cited by Suzuki: *Annals of Functional Analysis* 15 (2024), article 87.)
- **One-line relevance**: A concrete operator/quotient framework where **zeta zeros appear as a spectrum**, and where the **prolate wave operator** is repackaged as “(scaling generator)\(^2\) + (grading)”, with a semilocal analogue—this matches our Lean “operator ⇒ spectral-measure identity” intermediate targets.

#### Results to extract (high-signal statements)
- **R1 (cyclic pair canonical form; spectral measure)**: For a cyclic pair \((D,\xi)\) (self-adjoint \(D\) on Hilbert space \(H\), unit cyclic vector \(\xi\)), there is a probability measure \(\mu\) on \(\mathbb R\) and a unitary \(U : H \simeq L^2(\mathbb R,d\mu)\) sending \(D\) to multiplication by \(s\) and \(\xi\) to the constant function \(1\). (Theorem 2.1)
- **R2 (formal prolate operator of a cyclic pair)**: Given a cyclic pair, define the “formal prolate operator”
  \[
  \omega(D,\xi,\lambda) := D^2 + \lambda^2 N
  \]
  where \(N\) is the grading operator coming from orthogonal polynomials of the spectral measure. (Definition 2.2)
- **R3 (zeros as a spectrum in a quotient)**: They produce specific functions whose Mellin/Fourier transforms factor through the completed \(\Xi\)-function:
  \[
  F_\mu(E(\psi_{\pm\ell}))(s) = R_{\pm\ell}(s)\,\Xi(s)
  \]
  and conclude that the **spectrum** of “multiplication by \(s\)” on a certain quotient (a quotient of a Hadamard topological ring / closure of a span) is exactly the set of \(s\) with \(1/2+is\) a nontrivial zeta zero. (Proposition 3.6)
- **R4 (semilocal Hermite/prolate candidate)**: In the semilocal setting (finite set of places \(S\)), they construct a semilocal Hermite grading \(N_S\), identify the “archimedean-only” case with the usual harmonic-oscillator restriction, and propose a semilocal prolate operator candidate
  \[
  W_{\lambda,S} = (H + 1/2)^2 + \lambda^2 N_S
  \]
  together with structural statements about eigenfunctions and Jacobi-matrix representations. (Theorem 4.1 + surrounding discussion)
- **R5 (Sonin spaces + de Branges link)**: They define local/semilocal Sonin spaces, prove a stability property under enlarging \(S\), and recall/relate the classical link “Sonine spaces ↔ de Branges spaces” (Burnol/de Branges). (Section 4.5–4.8)

#### Assumptions / caveats
- **A1**: The “Weil quadratic form \(Q_n\) becomes a trace of an operator expression” is cited as coming from the semilocal trace formula framework (references [7], [9], [10], [11] in their bibliography). This paper mainly **integrates** these operator-theoretic ingredients and builds the semilocal prolate-operator framework.
- **A2**: The prolate operator is introduced via a **formal** expression; careful domain/self-adjoint extension issues are explicitly acknowledged (Definition 2.2 discussion).

#### Constants
- **Explicit?**: Not a constants paper; it is structural/operator-theoretic.
- **Depends on**: choice of semilocal set \(S\), parameter \(\lambda\), and the canonical measures/operators attached to the cyclic pairs.

#### Mapping to our framework
- **Maps to (Route 3 operator→measure scaffolding)**:
  - **Our operator target**: `RiemannRecognitionGeometry/ExplicitFormula/OperatorSpectralMeasureBridge.lean`
    - `OperatorQuadraticIdentity` / `OperatorSesqIdentity` match the “Weil form = ⟪A(Tf),Tg⟫” picture.
    - Their cyclic-pair spectral theorem viewpoint directly motivates our “spectral measure identity” packaging (`SpectralMeasureQuadraticIdentity` / `SpectralMeasureSesqIntegralIdentity`).
  - **Our quotient-by-radical step**: `RiemannRecognitionGeometry/ExplicitFormula/HilbertRealization.lean`
    - Proposition 3.6’s “quotient by the closure of a span” is philosophically the same move as the GNS-style quotient by the null-space (radical) of a positive semidefinite form.
- **What still needs translation**:
  - identify *which* test space \(F\) / transform corresponds to our `TestSpace.Mellin` conventions;
  - show the explicit-formula pairing \(W^{(1)}(\mathrm{pair}(f,g))\) equals the relevant operator pairing in their semilocal Hilbert space (this is the hard, RH-equivalent “bridge” step).

#### Can it discharge a blocker?
- **Best case**: provides a credible operator-theoretic *route* to the Route‑3 blocker:
  - (semilocal trace formula) ⇒ an `OperatorSesqIdentity` for \(W^{(1)}\);
  - (spectral theorem) ⇒ a `SpectralMeasureSesqIntegralIdentity`;
  - then we can aim to identify that spectral measure with the PSC boundary measure \(\mu_{\rm spec}\) (the splice).
- **Worst case**: mostly conceptual/motivational; does not on its own produce the `SesqMeasureIntegralIdentity` for the true zeta without importing the full semilocal trace formula technology as an axiom/citation.

#### Next actions
- **Extract**:
  - a clean “zeros as spectrum” lemma statement (Proposition 3.6 style) to cite in the written proof as motivation for the GNS/quotient perspective.
  - the exact operator expression for the prolate operator in terms of the scaling generator + grading (archimedean and semilocal cases).
- **Try to derive**:
  - a Lean-facing intermediate statement: “(trace-formula operator identity) ⇒ `OperatorSesqIdentity`” (as a new optional `Assumptions` bundle for Route 3).
- **If it fails, why**:
  - the missing piece is the explicit identification of the Weil pairing with the operator pairing in the semilocal Hilbert space (still RH-equivalent and deep).
