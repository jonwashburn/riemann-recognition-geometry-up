### Bellotti (arXiv:2405.12545) — “An explicit log-free zero density estimate for the Riemann zeta-function”

- **Citation**: Chiara Bellotti, *An explicit log-free zero density estimate for the Riemann zeta-function*, arXiv:2405.12545 (v2 used for extraction).
- **Primary relevance**: **B2′ / μ-Carleson (supporting only far-right zeros)**; gives explicit bounds for zeros with **real part extremely close to 1**.

### What the paper actually proves (key statements)

#### Definition (their \(N(\sigma,T)\))
For fixed \(1/2 < \sigma < 1\) and \(T>0\),
\[
N(\sigma,T) := \#\{\rho=\beta+i\gamma:\ \zeta(\rho)=0,\ 0<\gamma<T,\ \sigma<\beta<1\}.
\]

#### Theorem 1.1 (explicit log-free zero density estimate; shape + explicit constants)
For every \(T \in (T_0,T_1]\) and \(\sigma \in [\alpha_0,1]\) (with \((T_0,T_1,\alpha_0)\) taken from a lookup table in the paper), one has
\[
N(\sigma,T) \le C(\alpha_0,T_0,T_1)\, T^{\,B(\alpha_0,T_0,T_1)\,(1-\sigma)}.
\]

They also spell out a **uniform** (coarser) specialization:
- For every \(3\cdot 10^{12} < T \le \exp(6.7\cdot 10^{12})\) and \(\sigma \in [0.9927,1]\),
  \[
  N(\sigma,T) \le C\, T^{B(1-\sigma)}\quad\text{with}\quad B=1.448,\ C=1.62\cdot 10^{11}.
  \]

### Mapping to our framework (Lean + manuscript)

#### Our objects
- **Our μ** in `RiemannRecognitionGeometry/OscillationTargetTail.lean` is intended to be the **σ-weighted off-critical zero measure**:
  - coordinate: \((t,\sigma')=(\gamma,\beta-\tfrac12)\)
  - weight: \(\sigma'=\beta-\tfrac12\) (times multiplicity)
- **Our Carleson box** (`RiemannRecognitionGeometry/MuCarleson.lean` + `CarlesonBound.lean`):
  - `carlesonBox I α = { (t,σ') : t ∈ I.interval ∧ 0<σ' ∧ σ' ≤ α*(2*I.len) }`.

#### Translation dictionary
- Paper’s \(\sigma\) (real part threshold) corresponds to our threshold \(\beta \ge \sigma\).
- Our vertical coordinate is \(\sigma'=\beta-\tfrac12\), so \(\beta\ge 0.9927\) means \(\sigma' \ge 0.4927\).

---

### Can this discharge a blocker?

#### Best-case use (what it *can* help with)
- **It can control “very far-right” zeros** (e.g. \(\beta\ge 0.9927\)) strongly enough that their contribution to any *local window* is at most **linear in the window length**.
  - Reason: for fixed \(\sigma\ge 0.9927\), the exponent \(\theta(\sigma):=B(1-\sigma)\) is **< 1** (tiny).
  - Hence \(N(\sigma,T)\) is **sublinear** in \(T\), and by a mean-value/finite-difference bound one gets:
    \[
    \#\{\rho:\ \beta\ge \sigma,\ T-H<\gamma\le T\}
    \le N(\sigma,T) - N(\sigma,T-H)
    \ll_{\sigma} H
    \]
    with a constant depending on the paper’s \(C,B\) and (ultimately) on the minimal height where the explicit estimate is valid.
- In the **written proof**, this could justify treating large-\(\sigma'\) (large distance from \(1/2\)) zeros as a controlled “easy regime”.

#### What it does *not* give (core gap remains)
- **It does not touch the near-critical-line regime** \(\beta = 1/2 + O(|I|)\), i.e. the regime that dominates `MuCarleson` for small Whitney bases.
- Concretely: our `MuCarleson` must hold for **all** Whitney bases, including very small ones, and requires a uniform bound on
  \[
  \sum_{\rho \in Q(I)} (\beta_\rho-\tfrac12).
  \]
  Bellotti’s theorem only controls zeros with \(\beta\) extremely close to 1, not those with \(\beta-1/2\) tiny.

---

### Actionable extraction for us

- **Written proof**: cite Bellotti as an “explicit, log-free density bound near the 1-line” to justify that any μ-Carleson obstruction must come from zeros very near \(1/2\), not from far-right zeros.
- **Lean**: if we ever choose to model a two-regime proof, this suggests a lemma/assumption of the form:
  - “μ restricted to \(\{\sigma' \ge 0.49\}\) is Carleson”, leaving only \(\sigma' < 0.49\) as the hard regime.

---

### Verdict

- **Helpful as supporting technology** for ruling out “far-right zeros” as the source of B2′/μ-Carleson failure.
- **Not a direct path** to discharging `oscillationTargetTail_of_muCarleson` or constructing μ-Carleson in the regime \(\sigma' \ll 1\).
