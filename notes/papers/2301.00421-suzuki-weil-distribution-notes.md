### Suzuki (arXiv:2301.00421v3) — “On the Hilbert space derived from the Weil distribution”

- **Citation**: Masatoshi Suzuki, *On the Hilbert space derived from the Weil distribution*, arXiv:2301.00421v3 (paper version dated Nov 10, 2025 in the PDF).
- **Primary relevance**: **Route 3 (Weil/Li positivity ⇔ RH)**. This paper is *directly* about turning the Weil distribution pairing into an explicit Hilbert space, and identifying it with a **de Branges space / model space** picture.

### What the paper actually proves (high-signal statements)

#### Weil distribution and positivity criterion
- Defines the **Weil distribution** \(W: C_c^\infty(\mathbb R)\to\mathbb C\) by
  \[
  W(\psi) \;:=\; \sum_{\gamma\in\Gamma} m_\gamma \,\widehat{\psi}(-\gamma),
  \]
  where \(\Gamma\) is the (multi)set of zeros of \(\xi(1/2-iz)\), and \(\widehat\psi\) is the Fourier transform.
- States Weil’s criterion: **RH ⇔ \(W\) is nonnegative definite**, i.e.
  \[
  W(\psi * \widetilde{\psi}) \ge 0 \quad \forall \psi\in C_c^\infty(\mathbb R),
  \]
  with \(\widetilde{\psi}(x)=\psi(-x)\).

#### Weil Hermitian form and the Hilbert completion \(H_W\)
- Defines the **Weil Hermitian form** \(\langle\psi_1,\psi_2\rangle_W\) on \(C_c^\infty(\mathbb R)\) by
  \[
  \langle\psi_1,\psi_2\rangle_W := W(\psi_1 * \widetilde{\psi_2}),
  \]
  written explicitly as a sum over zeros (using the \(\sharp\) conjugation notation in the paper).
- Under RH, \(\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle_W\) is positive definite, so the completion gives a Hilbert space \(H_W\).

#### Theorem 1.1 (key structural result; RH-assuming)
Assuming RH, defines:
- a de Branges generator
  \[
  E_\xi(z) := \xi(1/2-iz) + \xi'(1/2-iz),
  \]
  giving a de Branges space \(H(E_\xi)\),
- a meromorphic inner function \(\Theta_\xi\) (built from \(E_\xi^\sharp/E_\xi\)) giving a model space \(K(\Theta_\xi)\).

Then **Theorem 1.1** asserts that the map \(K(\Theta_\xi)\to H_W\) given by
\[
F \mapsto [\psi_F],\qquad \psi_F := \mathcal F^{-1}(F)
\]
(Fourier inversion on \(L^2(\mathbb R)\)) is a Hilbert space isomorphism and satisfies a norm identity:
\[
\|F\|_{K(\Theta_\xi)}^2 \;=\; \|E_\xi F\|_{H(E_\xi)}^2 \;=\; \pi\,\langle \psi_F,\psi_F\rangle_W.
\]

### Mapping to our written/Lean blockers

#### Why this is *exactly* Route 3-shaped
Our Route 3 core target in Lean is a **Hilbert-space realization** (measure-first or inner-product-first) of the Weil pairing, e.g.:
- `SesqMeasureIdentity` / `SesqMeasureIntegralIdentity` in `RiemannRecognitionGeometry/ExplicitFormula/HilbertRealization.lean`
- or a “reflection positivity realization” target in `ExplicitFormula/CayleyBridge.lean`.

Suzuki provides:
- a canonical Hermitian form (the Weil form) on a concrete test space \(C_c^\infty(\mathbb R)\),
- an RH-equivalent positivity criterion,
- and (under RH) an explicit identification of its completion with a de Branges/model space.

This aligns extremely well with our existing “mechanical” Lean part:
- once you have **positive semidefinite form**, `HilbertRealization.lean` already builds the Hilbert space,
- Suzuki gives a candidate *canonical* Hilbert model for the resulting space (de Branges/model space).

#### What it does **not** solve
All central statements remain **RH-equivalent**:
- RH ⇔ Weil positivity is one of the hard equivalences (it’s “just another face” of RH).
- Theorem 1.1 assumes RH (it’s an identification *given* RH), so it does not discharge our splice identity without additional work.

### Actionable extraction (how it can still help)

- **Target shaping for Lean**:
  - gives a very concrete “alternate bridge target” besides `CayleyMeasureBridgeAssumptions.bridge_to_measure`:
    a typed package asserting that the Weil form completion is isomorphic to a model/de Branges space via Fourier+Cayley transforms.
- **Documentation for the written proof**:
  - strengthens the narrative that Route 3 wants a Hilbert space model, and that such a model naturally lies in the de Branges/model-space world (Lagarias lineage).

---

### Verdict

- **Very relevant** for Route 3 structure/target-shaping (arguably the closest external reference to our current Lean architecture).
- **Does not directly close the RH-equivalent analytic gap**, but gives a clearer “endgame model” and suggests alternate intermediate targets.
