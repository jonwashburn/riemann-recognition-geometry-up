- **One-line relevance**: Provides very clean RH ⇔ **screw-function / positive-kernel / integral-operator** criteria, which match our existing Lean “kernel positivity” Route‑3 bridge targets almost verbatim.

#### Results to extract (theorem shapes we can type in Lean)
- **R1 (RH ⇔ screw function)**: Let \(g(t)\) be the specific function attached to \(\xi\) (defined in the paper by (1.1) and (1.8)). Then
  - **RH is true iff** \(g(t)\) is a **screw function** on \(\mathbb R\). (Theorem 1.2)
- **R2 (RH ⇔ positivity of a hermitian form from the kernel)**: For each \(a>0\), define a kernel \(G_g(t,u)\) (paper’s (1.4)) and the hermitian form on compactly supported smooth functions in \([-a,a]\):
  \[
  \langle \varphi_1,\varphi_2\rangle_{G_g,a} := \int_{-a}^{a}\!\!\int_{-a}^{a} G_g(t,u)\,\varphi_1(u)\,\overline{\varphi_2(t)}\,du\,dt.
  \]
  Then
  - **RH is true iff** \(\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle_{G_g,a}\) is **nonnegative definite** on the paper’s test space \(C_0(a)\) for every \(a>0\). (Theorem 1.3)
  - Under RH they also get **positive definiteness** on \(L^2([-a,a])\) for every \(a>0\) (details in Theorem 1.3).
- **R3 (RH ⇔ nondegeneracy / “no zero eigenvalue”)**: RH is true iff the above hermitian form is **nondegenerate** on \(L^2([-a,a])\) for every \(a>0\). Equivalently, the integral operator
  \[
  (G_g[a]\varphi)(t) := 1_{[-a,a]}(t)\int_{-a}^{a} G_g(t,u)\,\varphi(u)\,du
  \]
  has **no zero eigenvalue** for every \(a>0\). (Theorem 1.4)
- **R4 (discretizations / moment criteria)**: The paper develops multiple discretizations of the positivity criteria (e.g. Hankel matrices of moments, Stieltjes moment problem viewpoints), giving additional RH-equivalent “finite-dimensional PSD” checks (see Theorems 1.7–1.8 and later sections).

#### Assumptions / caveats
- **A1**: The main criteria are **RH-equivalent**, not unconditional progress toward RH. Their value is that they provide alternate “typed gates” (kernel positivity / operator nondegeneracy) that may be more accessible than the PSC splice identity.
- **A2**: Some statements (e.g. full kernel nonnegative definiteness on all of \(\mathbb R^2\)) are conditional on RH; the paper also proves partial unconditional positivity in restricted regimes.

#### Constants
- **Explicit?**: Not the focus; this is structural (positivity/equivalence) rather than explicit numerical bounds.
- **Depends on**: the cutoff parameter \(a>0\) and the specific normalizations of \(g\), \(G_g\).

#### Mapping to our framework
- **Maps to (Route 3 “kernel positivity ⇒ RH”)**:
  - **Lean target already added**: `RiemannRecognitionGeometry/ExplicitFormula/ScrewFunctionBridge.lean`
    - our `IsScrewFunction g` is designed to match the paper’s “\(g\) is a screw function” condition (Theorem 1.2 shape).
  - **Optional stronger intermediate targets suggested by this paper**:
    - “positivity of the restricted hermitian form on \([-a,a]\)” (Theorem 1.3),
    - “integral operator has no zero eigenvalue” (Theorem 1.4).
    These can be packaged as additional Lean structures if we want a closer match to Suzuki’s proof architecture (integral-operator / Fredholm picture).
- **How it could feed the Route‑3 pipeline**:
  - kernel positivity gives a GNS/RKHS Hilbert space realization automatically (conceptually similar to `HilbertRealization.gns_hilbert_realization`);
  - what remains is identifying that RKHS pairing with the **Weil pairing** `L.W1 (pair f g)` (still an RH-equivalent bridge).

#### Can it discharge a blocker?
- **Best case**: gives an alternate Route‑3 gate that might be easier to attack analytically:
  - prove the specific \(g\) coming from the PSC/zeta data is a screw function (or prove the associated kernel is PSD);
  - then RH follows by Theorem 1.2/1.3/1.4.
  This would replace the “splice-completion spectral identity” blocker with a “kernel positivity” blocker.
- **Worst case**: purely repackages RH; still extremely valuable because it supplies **a precise Lean-facing target** (we now have it).

#### Next actions
- **Extract**:
  - a clean definition of the kernel \(G_g(t,u)\) in a form we can align with `Caratheodory.IsPositiveDefiniteKernelOn` (or with our existing kernel definition in `ScrewFunctionBridge.lean`).
  - the exact relationship between \(g(t)\), \(\Xi\), and \(\xi'/\xi\) normalization, to match our `ExplicitFormula` conventions.
- **Try to derive**:
  - (optional) a Lean packaging of Theorem 1.3/1.4 as additional intermediate targets:
    - `ScrewKernelFormNonnegOnInterval a`
    - `ScrewKernelOperatorNoZeroEigenvalue a`
- **If it fails, why**:
  - the missing link is still: connect the “screw kernel Hilbert space” pairing to the Weil/Lagarias test-function pairing used in our Route‑3 spine.
